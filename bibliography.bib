	abstract = {Inferences based on counts adjusted for detectability represent a marked improvement over unadjusted counts, which provide no information about true population density and rely on untestable and unrealistic assumptions about constant detectability for inferring diﬀerences in density over time or space. Distance sampling is a widely used method to estimate detectability and therefore density. In the standard method, we model the probability of detecting a bird as a function of distance alone. Here, we describe methods that allow us to model probability of detection as a function of additional covariates—an approach available in DISTANCE, version 5.0 (Thomas et al. 2005) but still not widely applied. The main use of these methods is to increase the reliability of density estimates made on subsets of the whole data (e.g., estimates for diﬀerent habitats, treatments, periods, or species), to increase precision of density estimates or to allow inferences about the covariates themselves. We present a case study of the use of multiple covariates in an analysis of a point-transect survey of Hawaii Amakihi (Hemignathus virens). Received 2 June 2006, accepted 2 November 2006.},

	abstract = {In the present vignette, we want to discuss how to specify phylogenetic multilevel models using brms. These models are relevant in evolutionary biology when data of many species are analyzed at the same time. The usual approach would be to model species as a grouping factor in a multilevel model and estimate varying intercepts (and possibly also varying slopes) over species. However, species are not independent as they come from the same phylogenetic tree and we thus have to adjust our model to incorporate this dependency. The examples discussed here are from chapter 11 of the book Modern Phylogenetic Comparative Methods and the application in Evolutionary Biology (de Villemeruil \& Nakagawa, 2014). The necessary data can be downloaded from the corresponding website (http://www.mpcm-evolution.com/). Some of these models may take a few minutes to fit.},

	abstract = {Morphological integration describes the degree to which sets of organismal traits covary with one another. Morphological covariation may be evaluated at various levels of biological organization, but when characterizing such patterns across species at the macroevolutionary level, phylogeny must be taken into account. We outline an analytical procedure based on the evolutionary covariance matrix that allows species-level patterns of morphological integration among structures defined by sets of traits to be evaluated while accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among taxa, providing a flexible and robust complement to related phylogenetic independent contrasts based approaches. Using computer simulations under a Brownian motion model we show that statistical tests based on the approach display appropriate Type I error rates and high statistical power for detecting known levels of integration, and these trends remain consistent for simulations using different numbers of species, and for simulations that differ in the number of trait dimensions. Thus, our procedure provides a useful means of testing hypotheses of morphological integration in a phylogenetic context. We illustrate the utility of this approach by evaluating evolutionary patterns of morphological integration in head shape for a lineage of Plethodon salamanders, and find significant integration between cranial shape and mandible shape. Finally, computer code written in R for implementing the procedure is provided.},

	doi = {10.1098/rstb.1989.0106},
	abstract = {A new statistical method called the phylogenetic regression is proposed that applies multiple regression techniques to cross-species data. It allows continuous and categorical variables to be tested for and controlled for. The new method is valid despite the problem that phylogenetically close species tend to be similar, and is designed to be used when information about the phylogeny is incomplete. Information about the phylogeny of the species is assumed to be available in the form of a working phylogeny, which contains multiple nodes representing ignorance about the order of splitting of taxa. The non-independence between species is divided into that due to recognized phylogeny, that is, to phylogenetic associations represented in the working phylogeny; and that due to unrecognized phylogeny. The new method uses one linear contrast for each higher node in the working phylogeny, thus applying the ‘radiation principle’. For binary phylogenies the method is similar to an existing method. A criterion is suggested in the form of a simulation test for deciding on the acceptability of proposed statistical methods for analysing cross-species data with a continuous y-variable. This criterion is applied to the phylogenetic regression and to some other methods. The phylogenetic regression passes this test; the other methods tested fail it. Arbitrary choices have to be made about the covariance structure of the error in order to implement the method. It is argued that error results from omitted but relevant variables, and the implications for those arbitrary choices are discussed. One conclusion is that the dates of splits between taxa, even supplemented by rates of neutral gene evolution, do not provide the ‘ true ’ covariance structure. A pragmatic approach is adopted. Several analytical results about the phylogenetic regression are given, without proof, in a mathematical appendix. A computer program has been written in GLIM to implement the phylogenetic regression, and readers are informed how to obtain a copy.},

	abstract = {Free and open source software (FOSS) is any computer program released under a licence that grants users rights to run the program for any purpose, to study it, to modify it, and to redistribute it in original or modified form. Our aim is to explore the intersection between FOSS and computational reproducibility. We begin by situating FOSS in relation to other ‘open’ initiatives, and specifically open science, open research, and open scholarship. In this context, we argue that anyone who actively contributes to the research process today is a computational researcher, in that they use computers to manage and store information. We then provide a primer to FOSS suitable for anyone concerned with research quality and sustainability—including researchers in any field, as well as support staff, administrators, publishers, funders, and so on. Next, we illustrate how the notions introduced in the primer apply to resources for scientific computing, with reference to the GNU Scientific Library as a case study. We conclude by discussing why the common interpretation of ‘open source’ as ‘open code’ is misplaced, and we use this example to articulate the role of FOSS in research and scholarship today.

We documented Indigenous Knowledge of bearded (ugruk in Iñupiaq), ringed (natchiq), and spotted seals (qasiġiaq) in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, USA, using semi-directed interviews with Iñupiaq hunters. This study originated from discussions with an agency of the regional municipal government to serve co-management efforts and understand habitat use of species subjected to climate change. Results indicated that ringed seals are associated with higher ice concentrations in winter than bearded seals and changes in sea ice retreat in spring may have greater impact on ringed seal habitat use because they are more likely to haul out on ice in spring. Additionally, all three species have foraging hotspots, used over several days by multiple individuals. Bearded seals, and to a lesser extent spotted and ringed seals, will use currents to forage. Results also revealed the use of inland water bodies and terrestrial habitat, which may become more important for bearded and ringed seals with changing ice concentrations and should be considered in management and conservation of these species.},

            Habitat loss is the leading cause of the global decline in biodiversity, but the influence of human pressure within the matrix surrounding habitat fragments remains poorly understood. Here, we measure the relationship between fragmentation (the degree of fragmentation and the degree of patch isolation), matrix condition (measured as the extent of high human footprint levels), and the change in extinction risk of 4,426 terrestrial mammals. We find that the degree of fragmentation is strongly associated with changes in extinction risk, with higher predictive importance than life-history traits and human pressure variables. Importantly, we discover that fragmentation and the matrix condition are stronger predictors of risk than habitat loss and habitat amount. Moreover, the importance of fragmentation increases with an increasing deterioration of the matrix condition. These findings suggest that restoration of the habitat matrix may be an important conservation action for mitigating the negative effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.},

	abstract = {In this era of global environmental change and rapid regime shifts, managing core areas that species require to survive and persist is a grand challenge for conservation. Wildlife monitoring data are often limited or local in scale. The emerging ability to map and track spatial regimes (i.e., the spatial manifestation of state transitions) using advanced geospatial vegetation data has the potential to provide earlier warnings of habitat loss because many species of conservation concern strongly avoid spatial regime boundaries. Using 23 yr of data for the lek locations of Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido; GPC) in a remnant grassland ecosystem, we demonstrate how mapping changes in the boundaries between grassland and woodland spatial regimes provide a spatially explicit early warning signal for habitat loss for an iconic and vulnerable grassland-obligate known to be highly sensitive to woody plant encroachment. We tested whether a newly proposed metric for the quantification of spatial regimes captured well-known responses of GPC to woody plant expansion into grasslands. Resource selection functions showed that the grass:woody spatial regime boundary strength explained the probability of 80\% of relative lek occurrence, and GPC strongly avoided grass:woody spatial regime boundaries at broad scales. Both findings are consistent with well-known expectations derived from GPC ecology. These results provide strong evidence for vegetation-derived delineations of spatial regimes to serve as generalized signals of early warning for state transitions that have major consequences to biodiversity conservation. Mapping spatial regime boundaries over time provided interpretable early warnings of habitat loss. Woody plant regimes displaced grassland regimes starting from the edges of the study area and constricting inward. Correspondingly, the relative probability of lek occurrence constricted in space. Similarly, the temporal trajectory of spatial regime boundary strength increased over time and moved closer to the observed limit of GPC lek site usage relative to grass:woody boundary strength. These novel spatial metrics allow managers to rapidly screen for early warning signals of spatial regime shifts and adapt management practices to defend and grow habitat cores at broad scales.},

	abstract = {Spatial regimes (the spatial extents of ecological states) exhibit strong spatiotemporal order as they expand or contract in response to retreating or encroaching adjacent spatial regimes (e.g., woody plant invasion of grasslands) and human management (e.g., fire treatments). New methods enable tracking spatial regime boundaries via vegetation landcover data, and this approach is being used for strategic management across bi­ omes. A clear advancement would be incorporating animal community data to track spatial regime boundaries alongside vegetation data. In a 41,170-hectare grassland experiencing woody plant encroachment, we test the utility of using animal community data to track spatial regimes via two hypotheses. (H1) Spatial regime boundaries identified via independent vegetation and animal datasets will exhibit spatial synchrony; specifically, grassland:woodland bird community boundaries will synchronize with grass:woody vegetation boundaries. (H2) Negative feedbacks will stabilize spatial regimes identified via animal data; specifically, frequent fire treatments will stabilize grassland bird community boundaries. We used 26 years of bird community and vegetation data alongside 32 years of fire history data. We identified spatial regime boundaries with bird community data via a wombling approach. We identified spatial regime boundaries with vegetation data by calculating spatial covariance between remotely-sensed grass and woody plant cover per pixel. For fire history data, we calculated the cumulative number of fires per pixel. Setting bird boundary strength (wombling R2 values) as the response variable, we tested our hypotheses with a hierarchical generalized additive model (HGAM). Both hypotheses were supported: animal boundaries synchronized with vegetation boundaries in space and time, and grassland bird communities stabilized as fire frequency increased (HGAM explained 38\% of deviance). We can now track spatial regimes via animal community data pixel-by-pixel and year-by-year. Alongside vegetation boundary tracking, tracking animal community boundaries can inform the scale of management necessary to maintain animal communities endemic to desirable ecological states. Our approach will be especially useful for conserving animal communities requiring large-scale, unfragmented landscapes—like grasslands and steppes.},

The 2010-2015 Land Cover Change of North America at 30 meters was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries.

      The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a 
      harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy 
      and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and 
      which meets each country’s specific requirements.

This Land Cover change map shows class transitions from 2010 to 2015

have been assessed from Land Cover maps at 30 meters resolution derived 
from Landsat Imagery over Canada and United States in 2010 and 2015, and
Landsat and RapidEye Imagery over Mexico in 2010 and 2015 respectively.},

            Providing science-based advice can be challenging. Personal in its reflections, the story that follows asks throughout: What constitutes an appropriate model for the communication of science-based advice that best serves society? The first “front line,” in 1992, involved tenuous hypotheses on the collapse and recovery of Newfoundland's Northern cod (Gadus morhua), raising troubling questions about political influence on science-based advice and on its integrity. These questions subsequently motivated a critique written with two colleagues on the communication of science to decision-makers, provoking a telling invective from a government department in defence of the status quo. The story transitions to my 2000–2012 tenure as a member and then as chair of Canada's national body advising which species should be on the legally binding national at-risk register, illustrating how politically sensitive science-based advice can be objectively, effectively, and independently communicated, unfiltered by vested interests. Since 2009, I have served as independent science advisor on the sourcing of sustainable seafood to Canada's largest food retailer, providing a meaningful, impactful opportunity to advise their decision-makers. Science-based advice, free from political and advocacy-driven vested interests, is a requisite return for tax-supported investments in science. If provision of such advice is a “moral imperative,” as argued more than 60 years ago by C.P. Snow, then scientists are obliged to be the best advisors that we can be.},

              Urban green space can help mitigate the negative impacts of urban living and provide positive effects on citizens’ mood, health and well-being. Questions remain, however, as to whether all types of green space are equally beneficial, and if not, what landscape forms or key features optimise the desired benefits. For example, it has been cited that urban landscapes rich in wildlife (high biodiversity) may promote more positive emotions and enhance well-being. This research utilised a mobile phone App, employed to assess people’s emotions when they entered any one of 945 green spaces within the city of Sheffield, UK. Emotional responses were correlated to key traits of the individual green spaces, including levels of biodiversity the participant perceived around them. For a subsample of these green spaces, actual levels of biodiversity were assessed through avian and habitat surveys. Results demonstrated strong correlations between levels of avian biodiversity within a green space and human emotional response to that space. Respondents reported being happier in sites with greater avian biodiversity (
              p
               {\textless} 0.01,
              r
               = 0.78) and a greater variety of habitats (
              p
               {\textless} 0.02,
              r
               = 0.72). Relationships were strengthened when emotions were linked to perceptions of overall biodiversity (
              p
               {\textless} 0.001,
              r
               = 0.89). So, when participants thought the site was wildlife rich, they reported more positive emotions, even when actual avian biodiversity levels were not necessarily enhanced. The data strengthens the arguments that nature enhances well-being through positive affect, and that increased ‘engagement with nature’ may help support human health within urban environments. The results have strong implications for city planning with respect to the design, management and use of city green spaces.},

	abstract = {The decline of biodiversity from anthropogenic landscape modification is among the most pressing conservation problems worldwide. In North America, long-term population declines have elevated the recovery of the grassland avifauna to among the highest conservation priorities. Because the vast majority of grasslands of the Great Plains are privately owned, the recovery of these ecosystems and bird populations within them depend on landscape-scale conservation strategies that integrate social, economic, and biodiversity objectives. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary program for private agricultural producers administered by the United States Department of Agriculture that provides financial incentives to take cropland out of production and restore perennial grassland. We investigated spatial patterns of grassland availability and restoration to inform landscape-scale conservation for a comprehensive community of grassland birds in the Great Plains. The research objectives were to 1) determine how apparent habitat loss has affected spatial patterns of grassland bird biodiversity, 2) evaluate the effectiveness of CRP for offsetting the biodiversity declines of grassland birds and 3) develop spatially explicit predictions to estimate the biodiversity benefit of adding CRP to landscapes impacted by habitat loss. We used the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of habitat loss and restoration on both the occupancy and species richness of grassland specialists within a continuum modelling framework. We found the odds of community occupancy declined by 37\% for every 1 Standard Deviation (SD) decrease in grassland availability [loge(km2)] and increased by 20\% for every 1 SD increase in CRP land cover [loge(km2)]. There was 17\% turnover in species composition between intact grasslands and CRP landscapes, suggesting grasslands restored by CRP retained considerable, but incomplete representation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Spatially explicit predictions indicated absolute conservation outcomes were greatest at high latitudes in regions with high biodiversity, whereas the relative outcomes were greater at low latitudes in highly modified landscapes. By evaluating community-wide responses to landscape modification and CRP restoration at bioregional scales, our study fills key information gaps for developing collaborative strategies, and balancing conservation of avian biodiversity and social well-being in agricultural production landscapes of the Great Plains.},

However, relatively few studies have linked subjective satisfaction to objective features of the environment. In this study we explore the links among objective environmental features (tree cover, water, and bird diversity) and subjective judgements of satisfaction. We surveyed residents of Ottawa, Canada (n = 1035) about their satisfaction with their local neighbourhoods. We then compared the survey responses to measures of nature near their homes, including bird diversity (number of bird species), tree canopy cover, and distance to water. After controlling for effects of income and subjective happiness, residents’ neighbourhood satisfaction was positively related to the number of bird species nearby, even before participants were prompted to consider nature. Residents’ appreciation of their local neigbourhood relative to others also increased with tree canopy cover and nearness to water. Unsolicited comments from participants following the survey indicated that while residents consciously appreciate trees and water, the relationship between bird diversity and neighbourhood satisfaction appears to be unconscious; very few of the participants mentioned birds. Based on these results, we speculate that a diverse local bird community may provoke feelings of satisfaction through their presence, activity, and songs. Our results create a compelling argument for city planners and individual residents to maintain bird-friendly spaces in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation decisions are difficult, especially when they involve differing values, complex multidimensional objectives, scarce resources, urgency, and considerable uncertainty. Decision science embodies a theory about how to make difficult decisions and an extensive array of frameworks and tools that make that theory practical. We sought to improve conceptual clarity and practical application of decision science to help decision makers apply decision science to conservation problems. We addressed barriers to the uptake of decision science, including a lack of training and awareness of decision science; confusion over common terminology and which tools and frameworks to apply; and the mistaken impression that applying decision science must be time consuming, expensive, and complex. To aid in navigating the extensive and disparate decision science literature, we clarify meaning of common terms: decision science, decision theory, decision analysis, structured decision-making, and decision-support tools. Applying decision science does not have to be complex or time consuming; rather, it begins with knowing how to think through the components of a decision utilizing decision analysis (i.e., define the problem, elicit objectives, develop alternatives, estimate consequences, and perform trade-offs). This is best achieved by applying a rapid-prototyping approach. At each step, decision-support tools can provide additional insight and clarity, whereas decision-support frameworks (e.g., priority threat management and systematic conservation planning) can aid navigation of multiple steps of a decision analysis for particular contexts. We summarize key decision-support frameworks and tools and describe to which step of a decision analysis, and to which contexts, each is most useful to apply. Our introduction to decision science will aid in contextualizing current approaches and new developments, and help decision makers begin to apply decision science to conservation problems.},

Increasingly, modellers are tasked with integrating data from multiple sources, collected via different observation processes. Distance sampling is an efficient and widely used survey and analysis technique. Within this framework, observation processes are modelled via detection functions. We seek to take multiple data sources and fit them in a single spatial model. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach: first accounting for detectability via distance sampling methods, then modelling distribution via a generalized additive model. However, current software and theory does not address the issue of multiple data sources. We extend the DSM approach to accommodate data from multiple surveys, collected via conventional distance sampling, double-observer distance sampling (used to account for incomplete detection at zero distance) and strip transects. Variance propagation ensures that uncertainty is correctly accounted for in final estimates of abundance. Methods described here are implemented in the dsm R package. We briefly analyse two datasets to illustrate these new developments. Our new methodology enables data from multiple distance sampling surveys of different types to be treated in a single spatial model, enabling more robust abundance estimation, potentially over wider geographical or temporal domains.},

	abstract = {Landscape pattern indicators or ‘metrics’ provide simple measures of landscape structure that can be easily calculated with readily available data and software. Unfortunately, the ecological relevance of many metrics (i.e. the relationship between metric values and the real-world ecological processes that they are meant to serve as proxies for) is often unproven and questionable, and concerns are regularly voiced that such metrics fail to capture important aspects of landscape function. In this paper, I provide a review of landscape measures that may better link landscape pattern and function, ranging from approaches that extend existing metrics by incorporating a more functional component (e.g. core area measures, least cost distances) to those rooted in graph, network, and electrical circuit theory. While more ‘functional’ approaches are becoming increasingly popular, the selection of appropriate landscape metrics in many applications involves tradeoffs regarding data requirements, ease of calculation, functional basis, and simplicity of interpretation by a range of specialist and non-specialist stakeholders. Regardless, there continues to be a need for landscape metrics because they are seen by many land managers and stakeholders as simple, intuitive tools for assessing and monitoring changes in landscape pattern and, by extension, the effects on underlying ecological processes. Future needs include: (1) the development of more user-friendly landscape analysis software that can simplify graph-based analyses and visualization; and (2) studies that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, including the potential limitations and biases in graph and network-based measures.},

We apply this approach to study the incidence of eastern spruce dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) in Minnesota black spruce (Picea mariana). A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources operational inventory of black spruce stands in northern Minnesota found mistletoe in 11\% of surveyed stands, while a small, speciﬁc-pest survey found mistletoe in 56\% of the surveyed stands.

	abstract = {Under limited time and resources, ecological managers are under increasing pressure to demonstrate tangible impact of monitoring activities. Value of Information (VOI) has been advocated as an ideal tool to evaluate whether more data is required to improve expected management outcomes. Yet, despite several recent works explaining its value, VOI remains seldom used in practice. Here we provide an example of a successful ecological application of VOI. We apply VOI to a novel multi-objective freshwater management problem and show how to make the best use of expert data through a robust sensitivity analysis. Unlike previous VOI approaches, our analysis provides statistical conﬁdence to our recommendations. We apply our approach to the recovery of Moira grass (Pseudoraphis spinescens) plains, a threatened vegetation community at the Ramsar-listed Barmah Forest on the Murray River, Australia. Working closely with managers, we discovered that although many threats may impede Moira grass recovery, reducing grazing pressure and applying ideal depth and duration of ﬂooding were most likely to lead to recovery. We found that learning from monitoring can signiﬁcantly increase the existing extent of Moira grass, although these gains are modest compared to immediate management action. Our study shows how VOI can be used to demonstrate efﬁcient use of limited environmental water to maximise ecological impact and increase transparency when making monitoring or management decisions. More broadly, the study methods will be of interest to any environmental manager who needs to prioritise monitoring and evaluation activities subject to a limited research budget. At a time where researchers and managers are asked to be more accountable for their decision-making, VOI provides a very accessible tool that can speed up the decision of whether to wait and collect more data or act immediately despite uncertainty.},

Both types of targets can be effective, but there are trade-offs, especially for broadly distributed taxa such as migratory species, a group for which conservation has been challenged by limited knowledge of distributions throughout the annual cycle. We combined spatiotemporal distribution models with population trend data to first examine focal areas for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds (n = 112 species) during the non-breeding period in the Western Hemisphere, based on a proactive approach (highest diversity) versus a reactive approach (strongest declines). For focal areas, we then assessed the extent of recent anthropogenic impact, protected area status, and projected changes in land cover using shared socioeconomic pathways. Spatial priorities for high diversity emphasized southern Mexico and northern Central America, and were strikingly different from areas with species in stronger decline, emphasizing the Andean cordilleras. Only 1.4\% of the non-breeding region met targets for diversity and decline, mostly in southern Central America. Areas prioritized to conserve high species diversity have experienced less recent anthropogenic impact than areas prioritized for species in decline but are predicted to experience more rapid land conversion to less suitable agricultural landscapes in the next three decades. Our findings indicate how efficient conservation efforts will depend on the careful consideration of desired targets combined with reliable predictions about the locations and types of land cover change under alternative socioeconomic futures.},

The authors used eBird data (the STEMs in particular) for weekly abundance estimates for several Neotropical migratory birds on their non-breeding ranges. Then, using Shannon index, they identified eBird pixels that had the top 20\% diversity (for proactive approaches) and top 20\% negative populations trends (for reactive approaches).

            Habitat loss is the leading cause of the global decline in biodiversity, but the influence of human pressure within the matrix surrounding habitat fragments remains poorly understood. Here, we measure the relationship between fragmentation (the degree of fragmentation and the degree of patch isolation), matrix condition (measured as the extent of high human footprint levels), and the change in extinction risk of 4,426 terrestrial mammals. We find that the degree of fragmentation is strongly associated with changes in extinction risk, with higher predictive importance than life-history traits and human pressure variables. Importantly, we discover that fragmentation and the matrix condition are stronger predictors of risk than habitat loss and habitat amount. Moreover, the importance of fragmentation increases with an increasing deterioration of the matrix condition. These findings suggest that restoration of the habitat matrix may be an important conservation action for mitigating the negative effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.},

            Edge effects often exacerbate the negative effects of habitat loss on biodiversity. In forested ecosystems, however, many pollinators actually prefer open sunny conditions created by edge disturbances. We tested the hypothesis that forest edges have a positive buffering effect on plant-pollinator interaction networks in the face of declining forest area. In a fragmented land-bridge island system, we recorded {\textasciitilde}20,000 plant-pollinator interactions on 41 islands over 3 yr. We show that plant richness and floral resources decline with decreasing forest area at both interior and edge sites, but edges maintain 10-fold higher pollinator abundance and richness regardless of area loss. Edge networks contain highly specialized species, with higher nestedness and lower modularity than interior networks, maintaining high robustness to extinction following area loss while forest interior networks collapse. Anthropogenic forest edges benefit community diversity and network robustness to extinction in the absence of natural gap-phase dynamics in small degraded forest remnants.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world have acknowledged that urgent action is needed to conserve and restore ecological connectivity to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. In this study we tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity for multiple species can be estimated across Canada using a single, upstream connectivity model. We developed a movement cost layer with cost values assigned using expert opinion to anthropogenic land cover features and natural features based on their known and assumed effects on the movement of terrestrial, non-volant fauna. We used Circuitscape to conduct an omnidirectional connectivity analysis for terrestrial landscapes, in which the potential contribution of all landscape elements to connectivity were considered and where source and destination nodes were independent of land tenure. Our resulting map of mean current density provided a seamless estimate of movement probability at a 300 m resolution across Canada. We tested predictions in our map using a variety of independently collected wildlife data. We found that GPS data for individual caribou, wolves, moose, and elk that traveled longer distances in western Canada were all significantly correlated with areas of high current densities. The frequency of moose roadkill in New Brunswick was also positively associated with current density, but our map was not able to predict areas of high road mortality for herpetofauna in southern Ontario. The results demonstrate that an upstream modelling approach can be used to characterize functional connectivity for multiple species across a large study area. Our national connectivity map can help governments in Canada prioritize land management decisions to conserve and restore connectivity at both national and regional scales.},

However, the development of such estimates at a national scale is challenged by a variety of factors, including sparse data coverage in remote regions, differential habitat selection across large geographies, and variation in survey protocols. With these factors in mind, we developed a generalized analytical approach to model species density in relation to environmental covariates, using the Boreal Avian Modelling Project database of point-count surveys (through 2018) and widely available spatial predictors. We developed separate models for each geographic region (bird conservation regions intersected by jurisdiction boundaries) based on covariates such as tree species biomass (local and landscape scale), forest age, topography, land use, and climate. We used machine learning to allow for variable interactions and non-linear responses while avoiding time-consuming species-by-species parameterization. We applied cross-validation to avoid overfitting and bootstrap resampling to estimate uncertainty associated with our density estimates. Results available at https://borealbirds.github.io/},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and ﬁt Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workﬂow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workﬂow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workﬂow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be ﬁtting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Ecology is the science that studies the interaction between organisms and their environment within the context of Darwinian evolution, and an ecosystem is defined as a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system. One topic that has been very much understudied and largely ignored in evolutionary biology is the overarching context of thermodynamics in controlling all biological processes and the evolution of life. Most fundamentally, organisms are self-replicating dissipative structures. Evolution is the process whereby variation in the structure of organisms have differential fitness in terms of their effectiveness at building and maintaining their structure, efficiently consuming free energy, and effectively reproducing and passing on those heritable variations, leading to change in the frequency of genetic variation and associated change in the characteristics in the population. The central process is dissipation of free energy according to the second law of thermodynamics, and evolution therefore is better conceptualized as the emergence of self-replicating dissipative structures that through natural selection become increasingly more efficient at degrading free energy. Ecosystems are linked series of dissipative structures with heat engine dynamics driven by random dissipation of energy and increasing entropy. The structure and composition of ecosystems across scales are emergent dissipative structures driven by the flow of energy and the increase in entropy. Communities and ecosystems are emergent properties of a system that has evolved to most efficiently dissipate energy and increase entropy. By focusing on the fundamental entity (energy), and the fundamental process (dissipation and disordering of energy and increasing of entropy), we are able to have a much clearer and powerful understanding of what life is, from the level of biochemistry, to evolution, to the nature of the organism itself, and to the emergent structures of ecosystems, food webs and communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Bird populations have declined across North America over the past several decades. Bird monitoring programs are essential for monitoring populations, but often must strike a balance between efficiency of data collection and spatial biases. Species- or habitat-specialist-specific monitoring programs may be helpful for increasing efficiency of sampling and understanding effects of management actions, but may be subject to preferential sampling bias if they are used to assess large-scale occupancy or abundance and monitoring is largely focused in high-quality habitat. More general monitoring programs, such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and eBird, may not preferentially sample specialists’ habitats but are subject to other forms of bias and often do not efficiently sample specialists’ habitats. We used an integrated occupancy model combining data from eBird, BBS, and Illinois state surveys of upland game bird habitat areas to estimate drivers of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and Ring-Necked Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) occupancy and compare inference from single-visit, multi-visit, and integrated monitoring programs. We fit sets of candidate models using every combination of the 3 datasets except for eBird by itself, to better understand how differences in spatial biases between programs affect ecological inference. We found that, for both bobwhite and pheasant, state surveys of upland habitat increased the predictive ability of models, and BBS data usually improved inference on occupancy parameters when it was integrated with other data sources. Integrating multiple data sources partially resolved the spatial gaps in each monitoring program, while also increasing precision of parameter estimates. Integrated models may be capable of combining the higher sampling efficiency of targeted monitoring programs with the more even spatial coverage of broad-scale monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {In the context of wildlife population declines, increasing computer power over the last 20 years allowed wildlife managers to apply advanced statistical techniques that has improved population size estimates. However, respecting the assumptions of the models that consider the probability of detection, such as
              N
              -mixture models, requires the implementation of a rigorous monitoring protocol with several replicate survey occasions and no double counting that are hardly adaptable to field conditions. When the logistical, economic and ecological constraints are too strong to meet model assumptions, it may be possible to combine data from independent surveys into the modelling framework in order to understand population dynamics more reliably. Here, we present a state-space model with an error process modelled on the log scale to evaluate wintering waterfowl numbers in the Camargue, southern France, while taking a conditional probability of detection into consideration. Conditional probability of detection corresponds to estimation of a detection probability index, which is not a true probability of detection, but rather conditional on the difference to a particular baseline. The large number of sites (wetlands within the Camargue delta) and years monitored (44) provide significant information to combine both terrestrial and aerial surveys (which constituted spatially and temporally replicated counts) to estimate a conditional probability of detection, while accounting for false-positive counting errors and changes in observers over the study period. The model estimates abundance indices of wintering Common Teal, Mallard and Common Coot, all species abundant in the area. We found that raw counts were underestimated compared to the predicted population size. The model-based data integration approach as described here seems like a promising solution that takes advantage of as much as possible of the data collected from several methods when the logistic constraints do not allow the implementation of a permanent monitoring and analysis protocol that takes into account the detectability of individuals.},

	abstract = {Background:  Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour.
Methods:  We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada.
Results:  Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35\%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85\%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario.
Conclusions:  Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.},

	abstract = {Bird species that are restricted to tidal marshes during one or all of their life stages are under increasing pressure from sea-level rise. To date, most of the research focused on this group has been conducted during the breeding season despite the fact that more than half of the annual cycle is spent on wintering grounds and the high likelihood that the winter period is the most critical time for adult survival. We used a double-pass rope-drag technique to estimate the winter abundance of sharp-tailed sparrows (

              ) and marsh wrens (
              Cistothorus palustris
              ) within tidal marshes of Virginia along 102 60X250 m transects between January and March, 2014. We used the first pass to remove birds from the transect and the second pass was used to estimate detection probabilities. The technique was highly effective producing detection rates of 98\% for sharp-tailed sparrows, 95\% for seaside sparrows, and 91\% for marsh wrens. We conducted three rounds of surveys and found that species-specific detection rates were comparable when we restricted our analyses to two survey rounds. Availability and abundance estimates deviated to a greater degree than detection rates when restricting data to that collected during only two rounds but confidence intervals overlapped for all three taxa, regardless of which two survey periods were used for the comparison. However, results were less precise when we restricted our analyses to two of three rounds with confidence intervals averaging 13\%, 45\%, and 14\% larger for detection, availability, and abundance respectively. The double-pass rope-drag technique provides an effective, unbiased sampling technique to estimate winter songbird abundance in saltmarsh habitat provided that at least two rounds are used and increasing the number of survey rounds will result in more precise estimates.},

            Shorebirds are declining to a greater extent than many other avian taxa around the world. In North America, shorebirds, along with aerial insectivores and grassland birds, have some of the highest proportions of declining species of any group. Here, we apply a new hierarchical Bayesian model to analyze shorebird migration monitoring data from across North America, from 1980 to 2019, and present the most recent available estimates of trends for 28 species. Point estimates for survey-wide trends in abundance were negative for 26 of 28 species (93\%). Despite challenges with low precision associated with migration count data, trends for 19 species had 95\% credible intervals that were entirely negative. More than half of the species were estimated to have lost \&gt;50\% of their abundance. Furthermore, estimated rates of decline have accelerated during the last three generations for most species. Point estimates of trend were more negative for 18 species (64\%) during the most recent three-generation period in comparison to the previous three-generation period. Many species now exceed international criteria for threatened species listing. The analytic approach used here allows us to model regional variation in trends, although survey coverage and strength of inference were greatest in the eastern portions of North America (east of 100°W). We found the greatest declines at staging sites along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Nova Scotia, and lesser declines along the Gulf Coast and in the midcontinental United States. The declines in shorebird populations reported here are worrisome and signal the urgent need for conservation action. In addition, it would be beneficial to validate these results through collection and analysis of complementary data, and to initiate demographic studies throughout the annual cycle to determine where and when declines are most likely to originate. This improved information will allow for development of more targeted efforts to reverse declines through conservation action.},

	abstract = {Effective monitoring tools are key for tracking biodiversity loss and informing management intervention stra­ tegies. Passive acoustic monitoring promises to provide a cheap and effective way to monitor biodiversity across large spatial and temporal scales, however, extracting useful information from long-duration audio recordings still proves challenging. Recently, a range of acoustic indices have been developed, which capture different aspects of the soundscape, and may provide a way to estimate traditional biodiversity measures. Here we investigated the relationship between 13 acoustic indices obtained from passive acoustic monitoring and biodiversity estimates of various vertebrate taxonomic groupings obtained from manual surveys at six sites spanning over 20 degrees of latitude along the Australian east coast. We found a number of individual acoustic indices that correlated well with species richness, Shannon’s diversity index, and total individual count estimates obtained from traditional survey methods. Correlations were typically greater for avian and total vertebrate biodiversity than for anuran and non-avian vertebrate biodiversity. Acoustic indices also correlated better with species richness and total individual count than with Shannon’s diversity index. Random forest models incor­ porating multiple acoustic indices provided more accurate predictions than single indices alone. Out of the acoustic indices tested, cluster count, mid-frequency cover and spectral density contributed the greatest pre­ dictive ability to models. Our results suggest that models incorporating multiple acoustic indices could be a useful tool for monitoring certain vertebrate groups. Further work is required to understand how site-specific variables can be incorporated into models to improve predictive capabilities and how to improve the moni­ toring of taxa besides avians, particularly anurans.},

              Ecologists are challenged to construct models of the biological consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we use a metapopulation model to predict the distribution of the Glanville fritillary butterfly during 22 years across a large heterogeneous landscape with 4,415 small dry meadows. The majority (74\%) of the 125 networks into which the meadows were clustered are below the extinction threshold for long-term persistence. Among the 33 networks above the threshold, spatial configuration and habitat quality rather than the pooled habitat area predict metapopulation size and persistence, but additionally allelic variation in a SNP in the gene Phosphoglucose isomerase (
              Pgi

However, the relative costs of conserving various taxonomic groups and the potential of these costs to interact with existing biases have been much less explored. We analyzed conservation programs across more than 2,000 species in 3 countries to investigate the costs of conserving species within taxonomic groups and how these costs might affect conservation planning. For each data set, we tested for differences in mean annual cost among taxonomic groups. For the data set from the United States, recovery plans differed in duration, so we also tested for differences in total costs among taxonomic groups. Although the costs for individual species varied widely, there were strong international consistencies. For example, mammals cost 8–26 times more on average to conserve than plants and 13–19 times more to conserve than aquatic invertebrates. On average, bird species cost 5–30 times more to conserve than plants and 6–14 times more to conserve than aquatic invertebrates. These cost differences could exacerbate unequal resource allocation among taxonomic groups such that more charismatic groups both receive more attention and require more resources, leading to neglect of other taxonomic groups.},

            Estimating absolute and relative abundance of wildlife populations is critical to addressing ecological questions and conservation needs, yet obtaining reliable estimates can be challenging because surveys are often limited spatially or temporally. Community science (i.e., citizen science) provides opportunities for semi-structured data collected by the public (e.g., eBird) to improve capacity of relative abundance estimation by complementing structured survey data collected by trained observers (e.g., North American breeding bird survey [BBS]). We developed two state-space models to estimate relative abundance and population trends: one using BBS data and the other jointly analyzing BBS and eBird data. We applied these models to seven bird species with diverse life history characteristics. Joint analysis of eBird and BBS data improved precision of mean and year-specific relative abundance estimates for all species, but the BBS-only model produced more precise trend estimates compared to the joint model for most species. The relative abundance estimates of the joint model were particularly more precise than the BBS-only estimates in areas where species detectability was low resulting from either low BBS survey effort or low abundance. These results suggest that community science data can be a valuable resource for cost-effective improvement in wildlife abundance estimation.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

	abstract = {Conservation scientists increasingly seek to find ways to implement their research for improved policy and practice. However, such efforts may be ineffective, or even counterproductive, if they are based on outdated models of science communication and behavioral change. Insights from fields that study how information is processed in the brain, how and why humans make decisions and take action, and how change spreads across social networks can support and improve existing efforts to translate conservation research into practice and policy. However, little of this research has made its way into the conservation science literature, thus limiting the power of these ideas to influence how research is communicated and how impact is understood. This paper seeks to address this gap by discussing four common myths about how to best communicate science for decisionmaking, namely, that facts change minds, scientific literacy will lead to enhanced research uptake, individual attitude change will shift collective behaviors, and broad dissemination is best. The article provides four alter­ native insights that can support effective science communication and impact: engaging the social mind for optimal decision-making, understanding the power of values, emotions, and experience in swaying minds, changing collective behavior, and thinking strategically for biggest impact. If we can understand how people process information, we can design interventions based on the best possible evidence of how humans make decisions for conservation management and policy.},

The real solutions to global problems at the local levels can only be expected through the widest possible social cohesion and the effective transmission of the results of science to all ages and social strata. One of the best ways to do this is by involving present or historical data from reliable sources of qualified and reliable amateur (citizen) scientists, which is an outstanding methodological opportunity to expand and increase the efficiency of scientific research. Therefore, citizen science has become more and more widespread within and between different disciplines in recent decades. One of the significant practical examples of this, with the persistent and accurate work of a late enthusiastic amateur data collector, Mr. László Cseh), who measured, collected and preserved main local climate data (that is, the average and maximum temperature and precipitation) over several decades in Csemő-Ereklyés region near Cegléd. The comparison of these data sets with the dynamics of the national middle-term data and the possibilities of their use in explaining plant phenology shifts are presented in this paper. According to our results, these local data sets fit well with the national trend and can increase the effectiveness of nature conservation by demonstrating the effects of climate change on plant phenology. Community science provides an opportunity for greater social recognition and acknowledgement of scientific results.},

	abstract = {Populations of the Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica; Scolopacidae) embark on some of the longest migrations known among birds. The baueri race breeds in western Alaska and spends the nonbreeding season a hemisphere away in New Zealand and eastern Australia; the menzbieri race breeds in Siberia and migrates to western and northern Australia. Although the Siberian birds are known to follow the coast of Asia during both migrations, the southern pathway followed by the Alaska breeders has remained unknown. Two questions have particular ecological importance: (1) do Alaska godwits migrate directly across the Pacific, a distance of 11 000 km? and (2) are they capable of doing this in a single flight without stopping to rest or refuel? We explored six lines of evidence to answer these questions. The distribution of resightings of marked birds of the baueri and menzbieri races was significantly different between northward and southward flights with virtually no marked baueri resighted along the Asian mainland during southward migration. The timing of southward migration of the two races further indicates the absence of a coastal Asia route by baueri with peak passage of godwits in general occurring there a month prior to the departure of most birds from Alaska. The use of a direct route across the Pacific is also supported by significantly more records of godwits reported from within a direct migration corridor than elsewhere in Oceania, and during the September to November period than at other times of the year. The annual but rare occurrence of Hudsonian Godwits (L. haemastica) in New Zealand and the absence of their records along the Asian mainland also support a direct flight and are best explained by Hudsonian Godwits accompanying Bar-tailed Godwits from known communal staging areas in Alaska. Flight simulation models, extreme fat loads, and the apparent evolution of a wind-selected migration from Alaska further support a direct, nonstop flight. Key words: Bar-tailed Godwit, energetics, flight mechanics, Limosa lapponica, migration, Oceania, wind-selected migration.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Species subjected to more variable environments should have greater phenotypic plasticity than those that are more restricted to specific habitat types leading to the expectation that migratory birds should be relatively more plastic than resident birds. We tested this comparatively by studying variation in flight initiation distance (FID), a well-studied antipredator behaviour. We predicted that variation in FID would be greater for migratory species because they encountered a variety of locations during their lives and therefore had less predictable assessments of risk compared to more sedentary species. Contrary to our prediction, we found that non-migratory species (sedentary) had greater variation in FID than migratory ones. Migratory and partially migratory birds had greater average FIDs than sedentary birds, suggesting that they were generally more wary. These results suggest that the predictability associated with not migrating permits more nuanced risk assessment which was seen in the greater variation in FID of sedentary bird species.},

	abstract = {K-fold cross-validation (CV) with squared error loss is widely used for evaluating predictive models, especially when strong distributional assumptions cannot be taken. However, CV with squared error loss is not free from distributional assumptions, in particular in cases involving non-iid data. This article analyzes CV for correlated data. We present a criterion for suitability of standard CV in presence of correlations. When this criterion does not hold, we introduce a bias corrected CV estimator which we term CVc, that yields an unbiased estimate of prediction error in many settings where standard CV is invalid. We also demonstrate our results numerically, and find that introducing our correction substantially improves both, model evaluation and model selection in simulations and real data studies. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Mark–recapture models have been widely used in ecology to estimate population sizes of animals. In contrast, estimation of plant population size has usually been assumed to be much easier. However, detection of individuals is difﬁcult for perennial plants, such as the rare prairie plant Mead’s milkweed (Asclepias meadii), which does not produce aboveground parts every year and lives in dense vegetation where nonﬂowering stems are hard to observe. In these cases, a count of the number of plants observed in a particular year may greatly underestimate the true population size, just as a count of animals in traps does not adequately estimate the total number of animals in an area. Using a family of closed population models (CAPTURE), we applied mark–recapture methodology to estimate population size of A. meadii. Over a 4-yr period, a total of 129 patches (aggregated collections of stems) was observed, with 124 ﬂowering in at least one year. In any one year, however, the number of ﬂowering patches ranged from 15 to 105. Using model Mth of CAPTURE with these data, the estimated number of patches capable of ﬂowering was 219. Although the conﬁdence interval is broad (95\% conﬁdence interval of 175–302), these results emphasize that the observed number of patches in any one year, or even over a 4-yr period, underestimates the actual population size.},

Some terrestrial orchids are able to undergo prolonged periods of vegetative dormancy, likely depending on specific fungi for surviving belowground, which pose an additional challenge in monitoring and targeted conservation. This study tests the feasibility of using environmental DNA to detect orchid tissue from soil samples as a tool in surveillance of terrestrial orchid populations. We developed species-specific probe-based qPCR assays targeting ITS regions of the rare orchids Anacamptis pyramidalis and Cephalanthera rubra and tested these on 183 soil samples from four localities with current or previously recorded occurrence of the species. A subset of samples (22) were additionally analyzed by ITS2 metabarcoding for a smallscale comparison between methods, as well as for characterizing plant communities associated with the orchids. Although the developed assays were highly efficient and specific, orchid DNA was only detected in 21 of the tested soil samples, all within close vicinity to the nearest orchid, and most within 10 cm. No orchid DNA was detected in any sample from the localities with orchid occurrence a few years prior to the study. The metabarcoding analysis only detected orchid DNA in a single sample but proved informative in characterizing the plant communities at the four tested localities. The developed assays would be highly useful to apply in studies aiming at gaining knowledge on dormancy and number of belowground individuals in populations of high conservation concern.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the
              mgcv
              package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data. All code and data used to generate this paper are available at:

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suﬀered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coeﬃcients, which can be problematic with weakly identiﬁed parameters, such as the logistic regression coeﬃcients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of eﬀective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a ﬁnite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an inﬁnitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the beneﬁt of both of these theoretical advances.},

Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer’s guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have used a variety of comparative mensurative and manipulative experimental approaches to study the biological consequences of habitat fragmentation. In this paper, we evaluate the merits of the two major approaches and offer guidelines for selecting a design. Manipulative experiments rigorously assess fragmentation effects by comparing pre- and post-treatment conditions. Yet they are often constrained by a number of practical limitations, such as the difﬁculty in implementing large-scale treatments and the impracticality of measuring the long-term (decades to centuries) responses to the imposed treatments. Comparative mensurative studies generally involve substituting space for time, and without pre-treatment control, can be constrained by variability in ecological characteristics among different landscapes. These confounding effects can seriously limit the strength of inferences. Depending on the scale of the study system and how ‘‘landscape’’ is deﬁned, both approaches may be limited by the difﬁculty of replicating at the landscape scale. Overall, both mensurative and manipulative approaches have merit and can contribute to the body of knowledge on fragmentation. However, from our review of 134 fragmentation studies published recently in three major ecological journals, it is evident that most manipulative and mensurative fragmentation experiments have not provided clear insights into the ecological mechanisms and effects of habitat fragmentation. We discuss the reasons for this and conclude with recommendations for improving the design and implementation of fragmentation experiments.},

However, the development of such estimates at a national scale is challenged by a variety of factors, including sparse data coverage in remote regions, differential habitat selection across large geographies, and variation in survey protocols. With these factors in mind, we developed a generalized analytical approach to model species density in relation to environmental covariates, using the Boreal Avian Modelling Project database of point-count surveys (through 2018) and widely available spatial predictors. We developed separate models for each geographic region (bird conservation regions intersected by jurisdiction boundaries) based on covariates such as tree species biomass (local and landscape scale), forest age, topography, land use, and climate. We used machine learning to allow for variable interactions and non-linear responses while avoiding time-consuming species-by-species parameterization. We applied cross-validation to avoid overfitting and bootstrap resampling to estimate uncertainty associated with our density estimates. Results available at https://borealbirds.github.io/},

	abstract = {Following the example of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, deriving numerical population estimates and conservation targets for priority landbird species is considered a desirable, if not necessary, element of the Partners in Flight planning process. Methodology for deriving such estimates remains in its infancy, however, and the use of numerical population targets remains controversial within the conservation and academic communities. By allowing a set of simple assumptions regarding species' detectability, relative abundance data from Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes may be extrapolated to derive first approximations of current, total species populations, both rangewide and within Bird Conservation Regions. Preliminary comparisons with independently derived abundance estimates (e.g., Breeding Bird Atlas) suggest that these population estimates are within acceptable limits of accuracy for many species. If restoring populations to early BBS levels (late 1960s) is desirable, trend data may be used to calculate the proportion of a species' population lost during this 35-year period, and an appropriate population target may be set. For example, in the Lower Great lakes/St. Lawrence Plain, BBS data indicate a current (1990-1999) population of about 14,000 Redheaded Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and a loss of {\textgreater}50 percent since 1966. A reasonable conservation objective, therefore, may be to double the Red-headed Woodpecker population in this region over some future time period. We encourage the use of numerical population estimates and conservation targets in implementing conservation objectives for priority landbird species, and we encourage further research that leads to refinement of our methodology and our estimates.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown the importance of accounting for burn severity when assessing the effects of forest fires on avian communities. We add to this growing literature with one of the first studies to assess these effects in boreal and hemiboreal regions of North America. We conducted point counts in control and treatment areas for 2–3 years before (2009–2011) and 4–5 years after (2012–2016) the Pagami Creek Fire in northern Minnesota, USA. Our primary objectives were to (1) assess the effects of burn status, burn severity and burn heterogeneity on avian communities and patterns of abundance in individual bird species and (2) compare these results when counts were either restricted to 100 m count radii or corrected for potential detection heterogeneity. Species richness and total abundance of birds were best described by a burn severity by year interaction, with lowerseverity burns having similar patterns to control areas and higher-severity burns showing reduced abundance and richness following the fire. Nevertheless, values associated with higher-severity burns returned to nearcontrol levels after five years. Of 43 species analyzed, 27 showed detectable responses to the fire through shifts in abundance. Nearly equal proportions of these species had generally positive versus negative effects of the fire. Sixteen (59\%) of these fire responses were mediated by burn severity, while four (15\%) and seven (26\%) were best predicted by burn heterogeneity or burn status, respectively. Of the species whose response to the fire was mediated by burn severity, the majority (81\%) had decreased abundance as burn severity increased. However, all species responding to burn heterogeneity or burn status showed positive relationships to these metrics. Results were similar between analytical methods that adjusted for species detectability vs those that did not, with 78\% of species having the same interpretation of fire effects. Burn severity and heterogeneity, in addition to the sole distinction of whether an area was burned, dictate the response of birds to forest fire in hemiboreal forests. Mixed-severity fires, which include a range of burn severities and associated vegetation change, will likely benefit the most bird species in this region. When possible, management should focus on retaining this spectrum of post-fire conditions, though of primary importance is the inclusion of wildfire in forest planning and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Encroachment, including human settlement, into the North American boreal forest has increased substantially in recent decades. This has resulted in changes in the dynamics, distribution, and functioning of this system with potential negative implications for avifaunal communities. Fuel breaks are often constructed around human settlements in forested landscapes to reduce the potential of damage to infrastructure from wildfires. The frequency and intensity of wildfire in boreal landscapes is projected to increase under future climate change scenarios. Thus, fuel breaks may become a more common management system around communities in the boreal forest. We assessed the responses of 21 bird species to the creation of a fuel break constructed around the village of Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. We surveyed birds for 2 years before (2000, 2001) and in 11 of 16 years after clearing (2002-2017; n = 14 sites) relative to reference sites (n = 3 sites surveyed since 2000 and n = 14 sites surveyed since 2006). The fuel break ({\textasciitilde}247 ha) was created in mature aspen-spruce forests and resulted in habitats resembling open parkland and open deciduous forest through removal of {\textasciitilde}95\% of the coniferous trees and continuous firebreak management. A community-level analysis indicated that open- and shrub-dwelling bird species became dominant following fuel break creation and for the duration of the study. Individual species-level analyses indicated declines in four avian species associated with older boreal forests (e.g., Bay-breasted Warbler, Setophaga castanea) and increases of six avian species typical of open and shrub habitats (e.g., White-throated Sparrow, Zonotrichia albicollis). However, trends of most species were similar in reference and fuel break sites likely due to the close proximity of reference sites to the fuel break. The fuel break in our study negatively affected most avian species that require older forests and, with ongoing maintenance, fuel breaks represent an unnatural component of the landscape in protected areas. Planned and ongoing expansion of the Waskesiu fuel break and creation of another fuel break (additional {\textasciitilde}395 ha) in Prince Albert National Park including clearing to protect commercial property outside the park warrant additional investigations into the impacts of fuel breaks on birds and other wildlife.},

	abstract = {Research Highlights: The eﬀects of ﬁre on birds in the most northern parts of the boreal forest are understudied. We found distinct diﬀerences in bird communities with increasing ﬁre severity in two vegetation types with naturally diﬀerent burn severity. The highest severity burns tended to have communities dominated by generalist species, regardless of the original vegetation type. Background and Objectives: Wildﬁre is the primary natural disturbance in the boreal ecosystems of northwestern Canada. Increased wildﬁre frequency, extent, and severity are expected with climate change in this region. In particular, the proportion of burns that are high severity and the area of peatlands burned are increasing, and how this inﬂuences birds is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: We quantiﬁed the eﬀects of burn severity (low, moderate, and high severity) in uplands and peatlands on occupancy, density, richness, community composition, and functional diversity using point counts (n = 1158) from the ﬁrst two years post-ﬁre for two large ﬁres in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Results: Burn severity had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the occupancy and density of 86\% of our focal species (n = 20). Responses to burn severity depended on vegetation type for four of the 18 species using occupancy and seven of the 18 using density, but were typically in a similar direction. Species richness and functional diversity were lower in areas of high severity burns than unburned areas and low severity burns in peatlands. Richness was not related to severity in uplands, but functional diversity was. Peatlands had higher species richness than uplands in all burn severities, but as burn severity increased the upland and peatland communities became more similar. Conclusions: Our results suggest that high severity burns in both vegetation types support ﬁve generalist species and two ﬁre specialists that may beneﬁt from alterations in vegetation structure as a result of climate induced changes to ﬁre regimes. However, eight species avoided burns, particularly birds preferring peatlands, and are likely to be more susceptible to ﬁre-driven changes to their habitat caused by climate change. Understanding the long-term risks to these species from climate change requires additional eﬀorts that link ﬁre to bird populations.},

	abstract = {1 The validation of field sampling techniques is a concern for applied ecologists due to the strong model assumptions implicit in all methods. Computer simulations make replication easy, but they do not give insights into how much bias occurs in real populations. Testing sampling methods on populations of known size can establish directly how well estimators perform, but such populations are very hard to find, and replicate, and they may have unusual attributes. 2 We present a field validation of distance and double-observer methods of estimating detection probabilities on aural avian point counts. Our research is relevant to conservation agencies worldwide who design thousands of avian monitoring programmes based primarily on auditory point counts. The programmes are a critical component in the management of many avian species. 3 Our validation used a simulation system which mimics birds calling in a field environment. The system allowed us to vary singing rate, species, distance, the complexity of points, and other factors. 4 Distance methods performed poorly, primarily due to large localization errors, and estimates did not improve for simplified points. 5 For the double-observer method, two pairs of observers tended to underestimate true population size, while the third pair tended to double-count birds which overestimated the population. Detection probabilities were always higher and population estimates lower when observers subjectively matched birds compared to an objective rule and showed a slight negative bias and good precision. A simplified 45-degree matching rule did not improve the performance of double-observer estimates which had a slight positive bias and much lower precision. Double-observer estimates did improve on the simplified points. 6 Synthesis and applications. We encourage ecologists working with sampling methods to develop similar methods of working with simulated populations through use of technology. Our simulated field evaluation has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately estimating population size when limited to aural detections. Problems are related to limitations in the ability of observers to localize sound, estimate distance, and accurately identify birds during a count. Other sources of error identified are the effects of observers, singing rate, singing orientation and background noise.},

	abstract = {The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is one of the longest annual avian surveys and has the greatest spatiotemporally extensive coverage in the Western Hemisphere. Although this important survey provides trend estimates for more than 400 species, it has limited coverage in the boreal forest and biases in representation and detectability that complicate inference. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the potential of new technologies and analytical approaches to increase coverage and improve monitoring efficiency. We documented variation in counts between BBS surveys (hereafter “human BBS”) and different on-road and forest-edge surveys using autonomous recording units (ARUs) from 3 routes in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Specifically, we quantified percent differences (i.e., bias in counts) in species richness, abundance indices of birds, and species-specific variation in counts between human BBS and ARU-based surveys conducted on-road and at the forest edge at different dates and times of day. We also generated on-road effective detection radius (EDR) estimates for 15 species and tested for species-specific differences in EDR to explain bias in counts between on-road and forest-edge ARU surveys. Overall, species richness and abundance indices in human BBS surveys were higher than forest-edge ARU surveys conducted simultaneously and when similar forest-edge ARU surveys were conducted at sunset and a week earlier in June. However, there was no difference when comparing values from human BBS with on-road ARU BBS and forest-edge ARU surveys conducted at sunrise. Extracting the maximum count per species from 4 types of 3-minute forest-edge surveys increased counts by 62\% and 64\% for species richness and abundance indices, respectively, relative to human BBS, but the importance of this bias differed considerably among the 10 most common species in the study area. Our results suggest that false-negative bias in species detection could be corrected with appropriate methods, and ARUs deployed at the forest edge near BBS stops could be used to increase data quality of on-road surveys. When combined with appropriate correction factors to adjust for surveys done at the forest edge, ARUs could also be used to increase the geographic coverage of boreal surveys by allowing inexperienced volunteers to collect BBS data along winter or secondary roads in remote locations.},

To our knowledge, effects of sampling duration on inferences from models of bird occupancy have not been evaluated. Our objective was to determine whether changing count duration from 5 to 8 min affected inferences about the occupancy of birds sampled in the Chesapeake Bay Lowlands (eastern United States) and the central and western Great Basin (western United States) in 2012 and 2013. We examined the proportion of species (two doves, one cuckoo, two swifts, five hummingbirds, 11 woodpeckers, and 122 passerines) for which estimates of detection probability were ≥ 0.3. For species with single-season detection probabilities ≥ 0.3, we compared occupancy estimates derived from 5- and 8-min counts. We also compared estimates for three species sampled annually for 5 yr in the central Great Basin. Detection probabilities based on both the 5- and 8-min counts were ≥ 0.3 for 40\% ± 3\% of the species in an ecosystem. Extending the count duration from 5 to 8 min increased the detection probability to ≥ 0.3 for 5\% ± 0.5\% of the species. We found no difference in occupancy estimates that were based on 5- versus 8-min counts for species sampled over two or five consecutive years. However, for 97\% of species sampled over 2 yr, precision of occupancy estimates that were based on 8-min counts averaged 12\% ± 2\% higher than those based on 5-min counts. We suggest that it may be worthwhile to conduct a pilot season to determine the number of locations and surveys needed to achieve detection probabilities that are sufficiently high to estimate occupancy for species of interest.},

            In many bird monitoring surveys, no attempt is made to estimate bird densities or abundance. Instead, counts of one form or another are made, and these are assumed to correlate with bird density. Unless complete counts on sample plots are feasible, this approach can easily lead to false conclusions, because detectability of birds varies by species, habitat, observer and many other factors. Trends in time of counts often reflect trends in detectability, rather than trends in abundance. Conclusions are further compromised when surveys are conducted at unrepresentative sites. We consider how to avoid these problems. We give a brief description of distance sampling methods, which allow detectability to be estimated. We consider strategies to ease their implementation, to enhance their reliability, to adapt the methods for difficult species, and to deal with circumstances in which representative sampling is problematic. We also consider some of the common problems encountered, and suggest solutions.},

Although population surveys often provide information on multiple species, these data are rarely analysed within a multiple-species framework despite the potential for more efficient estimation of population parameters. 2. We have developed a multiple-species modelling framework that uses similarities in capture/detection processes among species to model multiple species data more parsimoniously. We present examples of this approach applied to distance, time of detection and multiple observer sampling for avian point count data. 3. Models that included species as a covariate and individual species effects were generally selected as the best models for distance sampling, but group models without species effects performed best for the time of detection and multiple observer methods. Population estimates were more precise for no-species-effect models than for species-effect models, demonstrating the benefits of exploiting species' similarities when modelling multiple species data. Partial species-effect models and additive models were also useful because they modelled similarities among species while allowing for species differences. 4. Synthesis and applications. We recommend the adoption of multiple-species modelling because of its potential for improved population estimates. This framework will be particularly beneficial for modelling count data from rare species because information on the detection process can be 'borrowed' from more common species. The multiple-species modelling framework presented here is applicable to a wide range of sampling techniques and taxa.},

However, in forest habitats reptiles are secretive and the complex structure of the environment makes it difficult to assess with confidence their abundance and density. In general, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) or distance sampling (DS) are used to estimate demographic parameters of reptiles in these complex habitats. CMR may be expensive in terms of time, materials and sampling effort, while DS is strongly biased when animals lying on the transect line are overlooked. In this study, we applied a combination of CMR and hierarchical distance sampling (HDS) to esti­ mate the density of the Common Wall Lizard (Podarcis muralis), a widespread Mediterranean terrestrial reptile. We randomly placed linear transects in a deciduous woodland (i.e. Castanea sativa), in a coniferous plantation forest (Pinus nigra) and in a dry prairie habitat, and we applied a hierarchical mark-recapture distance sampling (HMRDS) protocol. Density estimates were similar between the deciduous woodland (47 individuals/ha) and the dry prairie habitat (44 individuals/ha), while markedly lower in the coniferous plantation forest (13 individuals/ ha). HMRDS data, analyzed in a Bayesian framework, showed the importance of correcting for the assumption of complete detection on the transect line, in all the three habitat types. Therefore, our approach should be useful when assessing the density of small and cryptic terrestrial animals, not only in forest but also in habitat with an apparently less complex vegetation structure.},

            Citizen science platforms are quickly accumulating hundreds of millions of biodiversity observations around the world annually. Quantifying and correcting for the biases in citizen science datasets remains an important first step before these data are used to address ecological questions and monitor biodiversity. One source of potential bias among datasets is the difference between those citizen science programs that have unstructured protocols and those that have semi-structured or structured protocols for submitting observations. To quantify biases in an unstructured citizen science platform, we contrasted bird observations from the unstructured iNaturalist platform with that from a semi-structured citizen science platform—eBird—for the continental United States. We tested whether four traits of species (body size, commonness, flock size, and color) predicted if a species was under- or over-represented in the unstructured dataset compared with the semi-structured dataset. We found strong evidence that large-bodied birds were over-represented in the unstructured citizen science dataset; moderate evidence that common species were over-represented in the unstructured dataset; strong evidence that species in large groups were over-represented; and no evidence that colorful species were over-represented in unstructured citizen science data. Our results suggest that biases exist in unstructured citizen science data when compared with semi-structured data, likely as a result of the detectability of a species and the inherent recording process. Importantly, in programs like iNaturalist the detectability process is two-fold—first, an individual organism needs to be detected, and second, it needs to be photographed, which is likely easier for many large-bodied species. Our results indicate that caution is warranted when using unstructured citizen science data in ecological modelling, and highlight body size as a fundamental trait that can be used as a covariate for modelling opportunistic species occurrence records, representing the detectability or identifiability in unstructured citizen science datasets. Future research in this space should continue to focus on quantifying and documenting biases in citizen science data, and expand our research by including structured citizen science data to understand how biases differ among unstructured, semi-structured, and structured citizen science platforms.},

	abstract = {Globally, many insect populations are declining, prompting calls for action. Yet these findings have also prompted discussion about sampling methods and interpretation of long-term datasets. As insect monitoring and research efforts increase, it is critical to quantify the effectiveness of sampling methods. This is especially true if sampling biases of different methods covary with climate, which is also changing over time. We assess the effectiveness of two types of flight intercept traps commonly used for beetles, a diverse insect group responsible for numerous ecosystem services, under different climatic conditions in Norwegian boreal forest. One of these trap designs includes a device to prevent rainwater from entering the collection vial, diluting preservatives and flushing out beetles. This design is compared to a standard trap. We ask how beetle capture rates vary between these traps, and how these differences vary based on precipitation levels and beetle body size, an important species trait. Bayesian mixed models reveal that the standard and modified traps differ in their beetle capture rates, but that the magnitude and direction of these differences change with precipitation levels and beetle body size. At low rainfall levels, standard traps catch more beetles, but as precipitation increases the catch rates of modified traps overtake those of standard traps. This effect is most pronounced for large-bodied beetles. Sampling methods are known to differ in their effectiveness. Here, we present evidence for a less well-known but likely common phenomenon—an interaction between climate and sampling, such that relative effectiveness of trap types for beetle sampling differs depending on precipitation levels and species traits. This highlights a challenge for long-term monitoring programs, where both climate and insect populations are changing. Sampling methods should be sought that eliminate climate interactions, any biases should be quantified, and all insect datasets should include detailed methodological metadata.},

	abstract = {In animal surveys, detectability can vary widely across species. We hypothesized that detectability of animals should be a function of species traits such as mass, color, and mean herd size. We also hypothesized that models of detectability based on species traits can be used to predict detectability for new species not in the original data set, leading to substantial benefits for ecology and conservation. We tested these hypotheses with double-observer aerial surveys of 10 mammal species in northern Botswana. We combined all 10 species and modeled their detectability with species traits (mass, mean herd size, color) as predictors while controlling for observer effects, vegetation, and herd size. We found support for effects of mass and an interaction between herd size and mean herd size on detectability. This model accurately predicted the ratio of herds detected by two observers vs. one observer for 8 of 10 species. To test whether a model based on species traits could be applied to a new species, we serially deleted each species from the data set, fit a trait-based model to the remaining nine species, and used this model to predict detectability for the deleted species. The model was able to reproduce the species-trait model for seven species and accurately predicted the ratio of detections by one or two observers for a different set of seven species; the model was successful by both measures for five species. To our knowledge, this represents the first time that a mechanistic model for detectability of animals has been used to predict detectability for new species. Prediction failed for species with extreme values of traits, suggesting that predicting detectability is not possible near or beyond the boundaries of one’s data set. The approach taken in this paper can potentially be used with a variety of taxa and may provide new opportunities to apply detectability corrections where they have not been possible before.},

	abstract = {A primary objective of ecological monitoring programs typically includes the efﬁcient detection of population trends. Passerines as a group are important ecological indicators and are often included in such programs to provide information on multiple species with a single survey technique. However, commonly used ﬁeld and analytical approaches may not provide appropriate inference or sensitivity due to assumption violations and differences in the proportion of the population exposed to sampling. Recent methodological developments utilizing repeated point counts and an N-mixture modeling approach for analysis may produce more consistent and interpretable estimates applicable to the superpopulation of individuals using a site during the breeding season. These estimates should be more useful for monitoring because they are not conditioned on presence or availability as are most single-visit approaches. We used repeated count data collected in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska (Denali) between 1995 and 2009 from 12 common passerine species to assess variation in presence and availability throughout the season, estimate trends in superpopulation abundance, and provide recommendations for the design of future monitoring programs. We found that variation in detection due to presence and availability was large and differed among species. After accounting for these sources of variation, we estimated abundance of Wilson’s warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) had declined by approximately 48\% and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) abundance had increased by approximately 250\% over 15 years. Combined, our results suggest that if trend estimation is a priority, passerine monitoring programs should formally address all components of the detection process, including the probabilities of presence and availability.},

	abstract = {Functional diversity (FD) approaches have been increasingly used to understand ecosystem functioning in bird communities. These approaches typically rely on the assumption that species are perfectly detected in the field, despite the fact that imperfect detection represents a ubiquitous source of bias in biodiversity studies. This may be notably important in FD studies, because detection may depend on the functional traits used to compute FD metrics. However, little effort has been devoted to account for imperfect detection in FD studies, and therefore the degree to which species traits and detectability affects FD remains poorly understood. We predict that observed FD metrics may either underestimate or overestimate detection-corrected FD, because FD has multiple independent dimensions with different data properties. We assessed whether detection was related to bird traits (body mass, diet, and foraging stratum), accounting for habitat type, season, and phylogeny. We then used a multi-species occupancy model to obtain detection-corrected FD metrics (functional richness [FRic], functional evenness [FEve], and functional divergence [FDiv]), and compared observed and detection-corrected FD estimates in bird communities from east-central Argentina. Some functional types of birds (raptors and insectivores) were more easily overlooked, whereas others (seed and leaf eaters) were more easily detected. Some observed FD metrics underestimated detection-corrected FD (FRic and FDiv), whereas some others (FEve) overestimated detection-corrected FD. Both observed and detection-corrected FRic revealed differences between seasons, but not between habitat types. However, detection-corrected FEve and FDiv showed differences between seasons, contrary to observed estimates. Our results indicate that failure to account for unequal ease of detecting species can lead to erroneous estimates of FD because some functional types of birds are more easily overlooked. We outline some guidelines to help ornithologists identifying under which circumstances detection may be a concern and warn against the indiscriminate use of FD metrics without accounting for species detection.},

That is, can be use information about species traits and phylogeny to gain better estimates of singing rate and/or detection distance? The authors used 5 species traits here: migration strategy, body mass, habitat associations, minimum sound frequency, and minimum nest height. The authors regressed log(singing rate) and log(detection distance) against these. The authors also used phylogenetic mixed models to estimate \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, the strength of phylogeneitic effects. The authors found that both singing rate and detection distance were in fact correlated to traits and phylogeny, but that strength differed for each one. The combination of phylogeny and species traits best explained singing rate, with phylogeny having the stronger predictive power. They found that long-distant migrants sang at a higher rate than residents. The detection distance was best explained by the traits only model, with large detection distances characterized by larger body mass, migratory species, and species associated with open habitats. The authors conclude that considering traits as somethgn that influences detection distance and singing rate would be a useful tool to be able to group birds to run as a multi-species model, alleviating small sample sizes in some species. That is, in my NA-POPS project, I could group sets of species taht share similar traits, and run that as a multi-species model to share information across those species to allow for data-poor species to shrink toward a mean caused by data-rich species.},

Results Passeriformes had the lowest median detectability of 0.37 and Charadriiformes the highest median detectability of 0.65, of the seven largest orders considered. Species most associated with closed habitats such as woodland and urban areas had the lowest detectability. Smaller species had lower detectability than larger species.
Conclusion Heterogeneity in species detectability could lead to biased conclusions, particularly when calculating multi-species indices such as species richness or diversity.

	abstract = {Cue counting is a method developed for estimating vocally active wildlife density by dividing the density of cues (number of cues per unit area surveyed per unit time) by the average cue rate (ACR) at which individuals vocalize. It has been used successfully to estimate whale density using passive acoustic monitoring, but its efficacy has had limited testing in birds. We tested whether cue counting can be used to infer bird abundance using autonomous recording units and estimated the minimum effort required to obtain a reliable cue rate at individual and population levels. We recorded Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti) vocalizations at 31 sites where traditional field censuses were also performed. We estimated the ACR using three methodologies: directional recordings, recordings from an online database of bird sounds (xeno-canto), and behavioral field studies. The ACRs estimated using directional recordings and behavioral field studies were similar, and bird numbers were over and underestimated by 0.8 and 10\%, respectively (74–77\% of the sampling sites were well estimated). However, the ACR estimated using xeno-canto recordings was much higher than those estimated using the other two methods, and bird numbers were underestimated by 41\%. We also performed a cost-effectiveness assessment of the number of individuals and recording durations needed to optimize the estimation of a reliable ACR. We found that ACR estimates were more efficient if long (25 min) recordings were used when {\textless} 4 males were recorded, whereas 5-min recordings were more efficient for ≥ 20 males. We conclude that cue counting can be useful to infer bird density around recorders but requires an accurate measure of the ACR. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of passive cue counting on a large number of species and under different circumstances.},

	abstract = {Bioacoustic recordings are often used to conduct auditory surveys, in which human listeners identify vocalising animals on recordings. In these surveys, animals are typically counted regardless of their distance from the survey point. When these surveys are carried out in patchy habitat or near edges, detected individuals may frequently occur in a diﬀerent land-cover type than the survey point itself, which introduces uncertainty regarding species-habitat associations. We propose a method to restrict detections from single microphones to within a pre-speciﬁed survey radius. The method uses logistic regression to select a sound level threshold corresponding to the desired distance threshold. We applied this method to acoustic data from the centre of 21 1-ha oil wellsites in northern Alberta. To compare our approach with the results from auditory surveys from the same locations, we used sound localisation to locate birds detected via both methods. Just 22.4\% of birds detected on auditory surveys fell within the desired survey area. Using our distance-truncation method, 96\% of detections were within the desired survey area. We propose that distance truncation via sound level will be useful for surveys of patchily distributed habitat, or when greater certainty about bird locations or habitat associations is desired.},

Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi–Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi–Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14–20 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11–17 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios–Ipsos online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have drawn contrasting conclusions about the extent to which local-scale measures of biodiversity are declining and whether such patterns conﬂict with the global-scale declines that have attracted much attention.1 A key source of high-quality data for such analyses comes from longitudinal biodiversity studies, which sample a given taxon repeatedly over time at a speciﬁc location.2 There has been relatively little consideration of how habitat change might lead to biases in the sampling and continuity of biodiversity time series data, and the consequent potential for bias in the biodiversity trends that result. Here, based on analysis of standardized routes from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (3,014 routes sampled over 18 years),3 we demonstrate that major local habitat change is associated with an increase in the rate of survey cessations. We further show that routes that were continued despite major habitat changes show reduced diversity. By simulating potential rates of loss, we show that the underlying real trends in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity can even reverse in sign if more than a quarter of diversity is lost from routes that ceased and are thus no longer included in surveys. Our analyses imply that biodiversity loss can be underestimated by biases introduced if continued sampling in longitudinal studies is inﬂuenced by local change. We argue that researchers and conservation practitioners should be aware of the potential for bias in such data and seek to use more robust methods to evaluate biodiversity trends and make conservation decisions.},

There is, however, limited theoretical understanding of the relationships between these 2 kinds of methodology, and limited understanding of relative strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, existing results have been obtained primarily in the setting of convex functions (for optimization) and log-concave functions (for sampling). In this setting, where local properties determine global properties, optimization algorithms are unsurprisingly more efficient computationally than sampling algorithms. We instead examine a class of nonconvex objective functions that arise in mixture modeling and multistable systems. In this nonconvex setting, we find that the computational complexity of sampling algorithms scales linearly with the model dimension while that of optimization algorithms scales exponentially.},

	abstract = {Declines in the spatial extent of the sagebrush ecosystem have prompted the consideration of conservation eﬀorts that view the greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage‐grouse) as an umbrella species at landscape scales. Conservation strategies that focus on an umbrella species, however, may have unintended negative consequences for co‐occurring species at ﬁner scales. In North America, grassland and shrubland songbird populations are declining faster than other avian groups. Conservation of sage‐grouse habitats may protect songbird habitats where distributions overlap. To assess the umbrella species concept at ﬁne scales, we quantiﬁed nest‐site selection for a sagebrush‐obligate songbird, the Brewer’s sparrow (Spizella breweri). We then compared the ﬁne‐scale habitat variables that inﬂuenced Brewer’s sparrow nestsite selection with ﬁne‐scale nest‐site selection for sage‐grouse in the Powder River Basin region of northeastern Wyoming, USA. We modeled nest‐site selection using conditional logistic regression for Brewer’s sparrow (2016–2017) and logistic regression for sage‐grouse (2004–2007). Both species selected nest sites with higher visual obstruction, shrub height, and branching density, although the selection for higher shrub height was stronger for sage‐grouse. Brewer’s sparrows selected nest shrubs with higher percentage of living foliage (vigor), and the opposite was shown for sage‐grouse. At the nest site, based on the variables we measured, our results suggest that Brewer’s sparrows and sage‐grouse select for similar habitat attributes, with the exception of shrub vigor of the nest shrub. The stronger selection for more vigorous shrubs in Brewer’s sparrows may be because they nest in shrubs, rather than on the ground under shrubs (as in sage‐grouse). Most of the conservation objectives for protection of sage‐grouse habitats appear to be beneﬁcial or inconsequential for Brewer’s sparrow. Local habitat management for sage‐grouse as a proxy for conservation of other species may be justiﬁed if the microhabitat preferences of the species under the umbrella are understood to avoid unintentional negative eﬀects. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {The environmental crises currently gripping the Earth have been codified in a new proposed geological epoch: the Anthropocene. This epoch, according to the Anthropocene Working Group, began in the mid-20th century and reflects the “great acceleration” that began with industrialization in Europe [J. Zalasiewicz et al.,
              Anthropocene
              19, 55–60 (2017)]. Ironically, European ideals of protecting a pristine “wilderness,” free from the damaging role of humans, is still often heralded as the antidote to this human-induced crisis [J. E. M. Watson et al.,
              Nature
              , 563, 27–30 (2018)]. Despite decades of critical engagement by Indigenous and non-Indigenous observers, large international nongovernmental organizations, philanthropists, global institutions, and nation-states continue to uphold the notion of pristine landscapes as wilderness in conservation ideals and practices. In doing so, dominant global conservation policy and public perceptions still fail to recognize that Indigenous and local peoples have long valued, used, and shaped “high-value” biodiverse landscapes. Moreover, the exclusion of people from many of these places under the guise of wilderness protection has degraded their ecological condition and is hastening the demise of a number of highly valued systems. Rather than denying Indigenous and local peoples’ agency, access rights, and knowledge in conserving their territories, we draw upon a series of case studies to argue that wilderness is an inappropriate and dehumanizing construct, and that Indigenous and community conservation areas must be legally recognized and supported to enable socially just, empowering, and sustainable conservation across scale.},

The Boreal Avian Modelling (BAM) Project is a 10-year-old project that has integrated the data from {\textgreater}100 avian point-count studies encompassing thousands of point-count surveys, and harmonized across data sets to account for heterogeneity induced by methodological and other differences. The BAM project faced the classic data-management challenges any LTEM must deal with, as well as special challenges involved with harmonizing so many disparate data sources. We created a data system consisting of 4 components: Archive (to preserve each contributor’s data), Avian Database (harmonized point-count data), Biophysical Database (spatially explicit environmental covariates), and Software Tools library (linking the other components and providing analysis capability). This system has allowed the project to answer many questions about boreal birds; we believe it to be successful enough to merit consideration for use in monitoring other taxa. We have learned a number of lessons that will guide the project as it moves forward. These include the importance of creating a data protocol, the critical importance of high-quality metadata, and the need for a ﬂexible design that accommodates changes in ﬁeld techniques. One of the challenges the BAM team faced—gaining access to relevant data sets—may become easier with the increased expectation by journals and funding agencies that documenting and preserving research data be a standard part of scientiﬁc research.

Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances.

Within this paper we review the literature of removal modelling and highlight the methodological developments for the analysis of removal data, in order to provide a unified resource for ecologists wishing to implement these approaches. Models for removal data have developed to better accommodate important features of the data and we discuss the shift in the required assumptions for the implementation of the models.

	abstract = {Substantial effort has been dedicated to developing reliable monitoring schemes for North American bird populations, but our ability to monitor bird populations in the boreal forest remains limited because of the sparsity of long-term data sets, particularly in northerly regions. Given the importance of the boreal forest for many migratory birds, we set out to (1) summarize the main challenges associated with monitoring avian populations, (2) describe the available statistical tools for population monitoring and their applications, and (3) identify future directions to overcome current challenges in monitoring bird populations in the boreal forest. Defining and delineating populations of interest and identifying the drivers that affect those populations present the greatest current challenges. This is because migratory birds may be affected by many population-limiting processes at different stages of their annual life cycles. These factors are often hierarchically structured and can influence populations at the local, regional, or continental scales. Some of the challenges associated with delineating populations and identifying population drivers can be addressed via the plethora of sampling and analytic methods available to examine population change over time. Choosing the proper analytic methods depends on the goals of the study and the nature of the data such as single or multiple populations, repeated occurrence or count-based surveys, or demographic rates. Recent advances in hierarchical and integrated population models make these analytic approaches some of the most promising avenues for the development of future methods. However, these tools require large data sets, and acquiring sufficient data on bird populations and potential explanatory variables is difficult in the boreal forest. If the current challenges to monitoring birds in the boreal forest are to be overcome, serious effort should be dedicated to integrating existing data and making them accessible. Enhancing survey effort through multispecies surveys will also play an important role. Implementing spatially balanced sampling plans with a rotating panel design could balance the trade-offs between spatial versus temporal replication at an affordable cost. Improving the accessibility of environmental covariates that are spatially and temporally explicit would also enable development of mechanistic population models that improve our understanding of migratory bird population dynamics. Finally, given that long-term monitoring programs can take many decades before delivering reliable population trends and that organizational priorities often change over time, we suggest that collaborative efforts will help ensure the long-term survival of new monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {We revisit the common standards recommended by Ralph et al. (1993, 1995a) for conducting point-count surveys to assess the relative abundance of landbirds breeding in North America. The standards originated from discussions among ornithologists in 1991 and were developed so that point-count survey data could be broadly compared and jointly analyzed by national data centers with the goals of monitoring populations and managing habitat. Twenty years later, we revisit these standards because (1) they have not been universally followed and (2) new methods allow estimation of absolute abundance from point counts, but these methods generally require data beyond the original standards to account for imperfect detection. Lack of standardization and the complications it introduces for analysis become apparent from aggregated data. For example, only 3\% of 196,000 point counts conducted during the period 1992–2011 across Alaska and Canada followed the standards recommended for the count period and count radius. Ten-minute, unlimited-count-radius surveys increased the number of birds detected by .300\% over 3-minute, 50-mradius surveys. This effect size, which could be eliminated by standardized sampling, was !10 times the published effect sizes of observers, time of day, and date of the surveys. We suggest that the recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995a) continue to form the common standards when conducting point counts. This protocol is inexpensive and easy to follow but still allows the surveys to be adjusted for detection probabilities. Investigators might optionally collect additional information so that they can analyze their data with more flexible forms of removal and time-of-detection models, distance sampling, multiple-observer methods, repeated counts, or combinations of these methods. Maintaining the common standards as a base protocol, even as these study-specific modifications are added, will maximize the value of point-count data, allowing compilation and analysis by regional and national data centers.},

We used a bird song simulation system to quantify the effects of detection distance, singing rate, species differences, and observer differences on detection probabilities of birds detected by ear. We simulated 40 point counts consisting of 10 birds per count for ﬁve primary species (Black-and-white Warbler Mniotilta varia, Black-throated Blue Warbler Dendroica caerulescens, Black-throated Green Warbler Dendroica virens, Hooded Warbler Wilsonia citrina, and Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus) over a range of 15 distances (34–143 m). Songs were played at low (two songs per count) and high (13–21 songs per count) singing rates. Detection probabilities averaged across observers ranged from 0.60 (Black-and-white Warbler) to 0.83 (Hooded Warbler) at the high singing rate and 0.41 (Black-and-white Warbler) to 0.67 (Hooded Warbler) at the low singing rate. Logistic regression analyses indicated that species, singing rate, distance, and observer were all signiﬁcant factors affecting detection probabilities. Singing rate 3 species and singing rate 3 distance interactions were also signiﬁcant. Simulations of expected counts, based on the best logistic model, indicated that observers detected between 19\% (for the worst observer, lowest singing rate, and least detectable species) and 65\% (for the best observer, highest singing rate, and most detectable species) of the true population. Detection probabilities on actual point count surveys are likely to vary even more because many sources of variability were controlled in our experiments. These ﬁndings strongly support the importance of adjusting measures of avian diversity or abundance from auditory point counts with direct estimates of detection probability.},

	abstract = {Counting techniques are widely used to study and monitor terrestrial birds. To assess current applications of counting techniques, we reviewed landbird studies published 1989–1998 in nine major journals and one symposium. Commonly used techniques fell into two groups: procedures that used counts of bird detections as an index to abundance (index counts), and procedures that used empirical models of detectability to estimate density. Index counts rely upon assumptions concerning detectability that are difﬁcult or impossible to meet in most ﬁeld studies, but nonetheless remain the technique of choice among ornithologists; 95\% of studies we reviewed relied upon point counts, strip transects, or other index procedures. Detectability-based density estimates were rarely used and deserve wider application in landbird studies. Distance sampling is a comprehensive extension of earlier detectability-based procedures (variable-width transects, variable circular plots) and a viable alternative to index counts. We provide a conceptual overview of distance sampling, speciﬁc recommendations for applying this technique to studies of landbirds, and an introduction to analysis of distance sampling data using the program DISTANCE.

            A robust knowledge of biodiversity distribution is essential for designing and developing effective conservation actions. The choice of a suitable sampling method is key to obtaining sufficiently accurate information of species distribution and consequently to improve biodiversity conservation. This study applies multi-method occupancy models to 36 common bird species associated with small ponds in the province of Murcia (south-eastern Spain), one of the most arid regions of Europe, in order to compare their effectiveness for detecting different bird species: direct observation, combined observation and video monitoring and mist netting captures. The results showed that the combined method and direct observation were similar and most effective than mist netting for detecting species occupancy, although detection rates ranged widely among bird groups, while some large species were poorly detected by all the methods used. Average detectability did not increase during the breeding period. The chosen approach is particularly applicable to both single- and multi-species bird monitoring programmes. However, we recommend evaluating the cost-effectiveness of all the available methods in order to reduce costs and improve the success of sampling designs.},

	abstract = {Background:  In boreal zone forest management is changing and degrading forest habitats, which has caused declines in biodiversity. To mitigate these harmful effects in production forests, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within them. These habitats include woodland key habitats, and other small habitat patches protected by voluntary conservation actions. In this systematic review we synthesize the evidence on the value of small protected habitat patches (SPHP) within production forest landscapes for biodiversity. Review question: Are small protected habitat patches within boreal production forests effective in conserving species richness, abundance, and community composition? Methods:  Both peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched from bibliographical databases, organizational websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Articles were screened at two stages (title/ abstract and full text) and the validity of the included studies were assessed. Screening and validity assessment were based on predetermined criteria. After data extraction, narrative and quantitative syntheses were conducted. Influences of effect modifiers were tested, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Review findings:  During the searches 19,458 articles were found. After duplicate removal and title/abstract screening 336 articles remained. During full text screening 41 articles were included and 35 of them (174 studies) were included in narrative synthesis. 28 articles with 127 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. SPHPs had significantly higher species richness compared to production forests. When compared to natural forests, there was no significant difference. Forest management in areas surrounding SPHPs did not have impact on species richness of these patches. Individual abundance was significantly higher in SPHPs compared to natural or production forests. There was significantly more dead wood in SPHPs compared to production forests, but when compared to natural forests there was no significant difference. Community composition was different between SPHPs and both production and natural forests.},

Formal surveillance programs—such as agency-led pest detection surveys—are thus key components of domestic biosecurity programs for managing invasive species. Independent sources of pest detection, such as members of the public and farm operators, also contribute to early detection efforts, but their roles are less understood. To assess the relative contributions of different detection sources, we compiled a novel dataset comprising reported detections of new plant pests in the US from 2010 through 2018 and analyze when, where, how, and by whom pests were first detected. While accounting for uncertainties arising from data limitations, we find that agency-led activities detected 32–56\% of new pests, independent sources detected 27–60\%, and research/extension detected 8–17\%. We highlight the value of independent sources in detecting high impact pests, diverse pest types, and narrowly distributed pests—with contributions comparable with agency-led surveys. However, in the US, independent sources detect a smaller proportion of new pests than in New Zealand. We suggest opportunities to further leverage independent pest detection sources, including by citizen science, landscaping contractors, and members of the public.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have drawn contrasting conclusions about the extent to which local-scale measures of biodiversity are declining and whether such patterns conﬂict with the global-scale declines that have attracted much attention.1 A key source of high-quality data for such analyses comes from longitudinal biodiversity studies, which sample a given taxon repeatedly over time at a speciﬁc location.2 There has been relatively little consideration of how habitat change might lead to biases in the sampling and continuity of biodiversity time series data, and the consequent potential for bias in the biodiversity trends that result. Here, based on analysis of standardized routes from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (3,014 routes sampled over 18 years),3 we demonstrate that major local habitat change is associated with an increase in the rate of survey cessations. We further show that routes that were continued despite major habitat changes show reduced diversity. By simulating potential rates of loss, we show that the underlying real trends in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity can even reverse in sign if more than a quarter of diversity is lost from routes that ceased and are thus no longer included in surveys. Our analyses imply that biodiversity loss can be underestimated by biases introduced if continued sampling in longitudinal studies is inﬂuenced by local change. We argue that researchers and conservation practitioners should be aware of the potential for bias in such data and seek to use more robust methods to evaluate biodiversity trends and make conservation decisions.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are among the most productive and economically valuable ecosystems in the world. However, because of human activities, over half of the wetland ecosystems existing in North America, Europe, Australia, and China in the early 20th century have been lost. Ecological restoration to recover critical ecosystem services has been widely attempted, but the degree of actual recovery of ecosystem functioning and structure from these efforts remains uncertain. Our results from a meta-analysis of 621 wetland sites from throughout the world show that even a century after restoration efforts, biological structure (driven mostly by plant assemblages), and biogeochemical functioning (driven primarily by the storage of carbon in wetland soils), remained on average 26\% and 23\% lower, respectively, than in reference sites. Either recovery has been very slow, or postdisturbance systems have moved towards alternative states that differ from reference conditions. We also found significant effects of environmental settings on the rate and degree of recovery. Large wetland areas (.100 ha) and wetlands restored in warm (temperate and tropical) climates recovered more rapidly than smaller wetlands and wetlands restored in cold climates. Also, wetlands experiencing more (riverine and tidal) hydrologic exchange recovered more rapidly than depressional wetlands. Restoration performance is limited: current restoration practice fails to recover original levels of wetland ecosystem functions, even after many decades. If restoration as currently practiced is used to justify further degradation, global loss of wetland ecosystem function and structure will spread.},

	abstract = {Aim Mapping species distributions is a crucial but challenging requirement of wildlife management. The frequent need to sample vast expanses of potential habitat increases the cost of planned surveys and rewards accumulation of opportunistic observations. In this paper, we integrate planned-survey data from roost counts with opportunistic samples from eBird, WikiAves and Xeno-canto citizen-science platforms to map the geographic range of the endangered Vinaceous-breasted Parrot. We demonstrate the estimation and mapping of species occurrence based on data integration while accounting for specifics of each dataset, including observation technique and uncertainty about the observations. Location Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Methods Our analysis illustrates (a) the incorporation of sampling effort, spatial autocorrelation and site covariates in a joint-likelihood, hierarchical, data integration model; (b) the evaluation of the contribution of each dataset, as well as the contribution of effort covariates, spatial autocorrelation and site covariates to the predictive ability of fitted models using a cross-validation approach; and (c) how spatial representation of the latent occupancy state (i.e. realized occupancy) helps identify areas with high uncertainty that should be prioritized in future fieldwork. Results We estimate a Vinaceous-breasted Parrot geographic range of 434,670 km2, which is three times larger than the “Extant” area previously reported in the IUCN Red List. The exclusion of one dataset at a time from the analyses always resulted in worse predictions by the models of truncated data than by the Full Model, which included all datasets. Likewise, exclusion of spatial autocorrelation, site covariates or sampling effort resulted in worse predictions. Main conclusions The integration of different datasets into one joint-likelihood model produced a more reliable representation of the species range than any individual dataset taken on its own, improving the use of citizen-science data in combination with planned-survey results.},

	abstract = {Bayesian data analysis is increasingly used in ecology, but prior speciﬁcation remains focused on choosing non-informative priors (e.g., ﬂat or vague priors). One barrier to choosing more informative priors is that priors must be speciﬁed on model parameters (e.g., intercepts, slopes, and sigmas), but prior knowledge often exists on the level of the response variable. This is particularly true for common models in ecology, like generalized linear mixed models that have a link function and potentially dozens of parameters, each of which needs a prior distribution. We suggest that this difﬁculty can be overcome by simulating from the prior predictive distribution and visualizing the results on the scale of the response variable. In doing so, some common choices for non-informative priors on parameters can easily be seen to produce biologically impossible values of response variables. Such implications of prior choices are difﬁcult to foresee without visualization. We demonstrate a workﬂow for prior selection using simulation and visualization with two ecological examples (predator–prey body sizes and spider responses to food competition). This approach is not new, but its adoption by ecologists will help to better incorporate prior information in ecological models, thereby maximizing one of the beneﬁts of Bayesian data analysis.},

Many GitHub repositories did not use key features that could help developers to gather user feedback, or to create and revise standards that build on previous work.

	abstract = {A new statistical approach is described for predicting the irreplaceability of areas (or `sites') within a region, de®ned as the likelihood that a given site will need to be protected to ensure achievement of a set of regional conservation targets. The paper begins by clarifying the relationship between irreplaceability and other conservation planning concepts such as ¯exibility, rarity, endemism and complementarity. We explain why direct measurement of irreplaceability is currently intractable for most real-world applications, and hence the need for prediction. A new predictive approach is proposed which overcomes a number of major shortcomings of previous approaches to predicting irreplaceability. The new approach employs the central limit theorem to estimate the expected frequency distribution of the area of a feature protected by all possible combinations of a set of sites. This expected distribution is used to estimate the total number of site combinations that would achieve target for the feature. The distribution is then used, for each site in turn, to estimate the number of these combinations for which the site of interest is a critical component. This latter number, expressed as a proportion of the estimated total number of representative combinations, provides a measure of the irreplaceability of a site for a single feature. Two techniques are presented for extending this approach to measure irreplaceability in terms of multiple features. Recent application of the new predictor to regional conservation planning in eastern New South Wales and elsewhere is described, with examples. We then present results of a preliminary evaluation of the accuracy of the predictor. Finally, we outline a future research agenda for further validation and re®nement of the new technique. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The proportion of budgets allocated to research and monitoring vary among jurisdictions and taxa, but overall, species with higher proportions of budgets allocated to research and monitoring have poorer recovery outcomes. The proportion allocated to research and monitoring is lower for more recent recovery plans, but for some species, plans have allocated the majority of funds to information gathering for decades. We provide recommendations for careful examination of the value of collecting new information in recovery planning to ensure that conservation programs emphasize action or research and monitoring that directly informs action.},

              As pollinators, hummingbirds play a critical role for both the function of ecological communities and in providing ecosystem services for people. To examine the conservation status of North American hummingbirds, we analyzed Breeding Bird Survey data for 8 species and 3 genera from 1970 to 2019 (long-term) and from 2009 to 2019 (short-term, approximately three generations). Among the
              Selasphorus
              genus, Allen’s, rufous, and broad-tailed hummingbirds have declined since 1970, and the rate of decline increased from 2009 to 2019. Contrasting the trends from the past half-century, ruby-throated hummingbirds of Eastern North America have declined since approximately 2004 throughout most of the species’ breeding range. In contrast, Anna’s hummingbird populations have increased dramatically since 1970 in their range in western North America. We also tested whether apparent declines might be due to a growing mismatch between the timing of breeding and the timing of BBS surveys. We found no evidence for such an effect, thus supporting the hypothesis that trends reflect true demographic change. Our analyses and geographic modelling highlight the urgent need of regulatory action to conserve hummingbirds uniquely capable of filling their niche in North America.},

Although significant improvements have been made to correct for false negative (FN) error, less work has been done on identifying and modeling false positive (FP) error. In our online survey we found misidentification can occur even among highly skilled observers, thus methods are required to correct for FP error. In this study we model both FP and FN error in bird surveys using a multiple detection state model (MDSM), and found that modeling both types of error lowered occupancy (ψ) relative to the FN only models in 84\% of the observation data sets, and this suggests significant bias in ψ can occur in studies that do not correct for both FN and FP error. In our autonomous recording units (ARU) data we had two detection states, “confirmed” and “unconfirmed,” where confirmation was based on agreement of two interpreters, and through simulation evaluated performance of the MDSM using this type of ARU data. We found that MDSM can effectively correct for both FN and FP error across a broad of range of survey observation rates and detection rates (d) and is appropriate for data using “confirmed detections.” We developed a binary classification model to assign risk of bias to field observation sets based on survey and model parameters, and found that lower risk of bias cannot be predicted by a single variable or value, but rather occurs under certain combinations of low naïve occupancy rate ({\textless} {\textasciitilde}0.2), detection rate ({\textless} {\textasciitilde}0.2), number of confirmed recordings ({\textless} {\textasciitilde}20) and high FP rate ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}0.07). Our approach to interpreting ARU data along with our analysis guidelines should help reduce potential inflation of ψ resulting from FP error.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss is a global ecological crisis that is both a driver of and response to environmental change. Understanding the connections between species declines and other components of human-natural systems extends across the physical, life, and social sciences. From an analysis perspective, this requires integration of data from different scientific domains, which often have heterogeneous scales and resolutions. Community science projects such as eBird may help to fill spatiotemporal gaps and enhance the resolution of standardized biological surveys. Comparisons between eBird and the more comprehensive North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) have found these datasets can produce consistent multi-year abundance trends for bird populations at national and regional scales. Here we investigate the reliability of these datasets for estimating patterns at finer resolutions, inter-annual changes in abundance within town boundaries. Using a case study of 14 focal species within Massachusetts, we calculated four indices of annual relative abundance using eBird and BBS datasets, including two different modeling approaches within each dataset. We compared the correspondence between these indices in terms of multi-year trends, annual estimates, and inter-annual changes in estimates at the state and town-level. We found correspondence between eBird and BBS multi-year trends, but this was not consistent across all species and diminished at finer, inter-annual temporal resolutions. We further show that standardizing modeling approaches can increase index reliability even between datasets at coarser temporal resolutions. Our results indicate that multiple datasets and modeling methods should be considered when estimating species population dynamics at finer temporal resolutions, but standardizing modeling approaches may improve estimate correspondence between abundance datasets. In addition, reliability of these indices at finer spatial scales may depend on habitat composition, which can impact survey accuracy.},

	abstract = {Species identiﬁcation typically is assumed certain in population ecology. However, partial identiﬁcation (to lowest certain taxon) and misidentiﬁcation (collectively “uncertain identiﬁcation”) have pervaded surveys. Consequent bias in occupancy and abundance estimates impairs inference and decision-making, but methods for estimating uncertain identiﬁcation and remedying its effects have required restrictive assumptions or utilized artiﬁcial cues. I present likelihood-based multi-observer methods for estimating uncertain identiﬁcation during surveys enumerating individuals, assess performance via simulation study, demonstrate application to line transects, and provide recommendations for use and further development. Methods typically employ three or more independent observers using one or more observation methods. Species identity is a latent state, and discrepancies in species classiﬁcations of the same individuals or groups enable estimation of uncertain identiﬁcation and true species composition of detected individuals. Because complete or certain classiﬁcations are not required for any observer, methods uniquely beﬁt surveys for free-ranging, unmarked animals. Methods permit arbitrary numbers of species and observation states, multi-species groups, covariates, and distinct uncertain identiﬁcation for each species, observer, and observation state. Innovative technologies for acquiring recorded observations (e.g., digital media of survey observations) complement methods by enabling post hoc classiﬁcations by independent observers and enhanced species identiﬁcation (e.g., replays, magniﬁcation, spectrograms). Using multi-observation methods (MOM), classiﬁcations by observers at sampling sites are supplemented with classiﬁcations from recorded observations by additional observers. Alternatively, recorded observations can be acquired solely via technology (e.g., unmanned aerial systems, autonomous recording units). Multi-observation methods enable supplementing automated classiﬁcations (e.g., machine learning) with classiﬁcations by humans, while single-observation methods allow classiﬁcations by multiple human observers. Simulations demonstrated good model performance and robustness, except to high un-modeled heterogeneity in misidentiﬁcation. Minimizing misidentiﬁcation and other practical steps enhance precision and accuracy of results. I applied MOM to line transects for two genus Brachyramphus murrelet species by photographing a sample of detected groups. Post hoc classiﬁcations from photographs by three independent observers had lower misidentiﬁcation and partial identiﬁcation (0.6\%, 9\%) vs. experienced observers at survey sites (3.2\%, 23\%). Integrating multi-observer methods with other methods (e.g., distance sampling, N-mixture models) enables estimation of occupancy or abundance accounting for uncertain detection and identiﬁcation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01894},
	abstract = {The occurrence and distributions of wildlife populations and communities are shifting as a result of global changes. To evaluate whether these shifts are negatively impacting biodiversity processes, it is critical to monitor the status, trends, and effects of environmental variables on entire communities. However, modeling the dynamics of multiple species simultaneously can require large amounts of diverse data, and few modeling approaches exist to simultaneously provide species and community level inferences. We present an "integrated community occupancy model" (ICOM) that unites principles of data integration and hierarchical community modeling in a single framework to provide inferences on species-specific and community occurrence dynamics using multiple data sources. We use simulations to compare the ICOM to previously developed hierarchical community occupancy models and single species integrated distribution models. We then apply our model to assess the occurrence and biodiversity dynamics of foliage-gleaning birds in the White Mountain National Forest in the northeastern USA from 2010-2018 using three independent data sources. Simulations reveal that integrating multiple data sources in the ICOM increased precision and accuracy of species and community level inferences compared to single data source models, although benefits of integration were dependent on data source quality (e.g., amount of replication). Compared to single species models, the ICOM yielded more precise species-level estimates. Within our case study, the ICOM had the highest out-of-sample predictive performance compared to single species models and models that used only a subset of the three data sources. The ICOM offers an attractive approach to estimate species and biodiversity dynamics, which is additionally valuable to inform management objectives of both individual species and their broader communities.},

	abstract = {The Partners in Flight North American Landbird Conservation Plan provided estimates of population sizes for 448 landbird species using a multiplicative model. Input parameters in this calculation included the area of state × Bird Conservation Region polygons, area-speciﬁc mean Breeding Bird Survey counts circa 1995, and adjustment factors for the distance over which species may presumably be correctly counted, the assumed pairing of singing males with non-singing females, and variability in the propensity of birds to sing over the course of the survey day. I assessed the sensitivity of this population calculation to changes in the input parameters. I assessed both local and global sensitivity of the model to changes in the parameters with Monte Carlo one-at-a-time simulations and the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST). Monte Carlo simulations were an estimate of local model sensitivity whereas FAST estimated global model sensitivity, accommodating the potential shared variance between model parameters. Monte Carlo simulations suggested population estimates were 39\% more sensitive to changes in the detection distance adjustment than to the other parameters; the other parameters were nearly equal in their contribution to model sensitivity. Conversely, FAST analysis determined that each of the input variables aside from the pair adjustment provided roughly equal contributions to variability in population estimates. The most efﬁcient means for improving continental population estimates for birds surveyed by the Breeding Bird Survey will be through increased scrutiny of the species-speciﬁc distance detection and time-of-day adjustments and improved understanding in the spatial and temporal variability in the mean Breeding Bird Survey count.},

We found that the choice of model had an impact on the estimability of unknown model parameters and affected the bias and variance of corrected counts. Finite mixture models provided better fit than conventional removal models and better adjusted for count duration. However, reliably estimating parameters and minimizing variance using mixture models required at least 200–1,000 detections. Mixture models with time-varying proportions of infrequent singers were best supported across species, indicating that accounting for date- and time-related heterogeneity is important when combining data across studies over large spatial scales, multiple sampling time frames, or variable survey protocols. Our flexible and continuous time-removal modeling framework can be used to account for such heterogeneity through the incorporation of easily obtainable covariates, such as methods, date, time, and location. Accounting for availability bias in bird surveys allows for better integration of disparate studies at large spatial scales and better adjustment of local, regional, and continental population size estimates.},

	abstract = {The closure assumption of many abundance models, that individual animals are present throughout the survey season, often is inconsistent with field data. The effects of closure-assumption violations on estimators of abundance and associations between abundance and covariates are not fully understood. Furthermore, one’s definition of abundance affects these estimates. We used simulated data on breeding birds to explore how per­ manent, non-random immigration and emigration that violate the closure assumption affect estimates from Nmixture abundance models and naïve models (models that do not account for imperfect detection). This is the first work to evaluate the effect of permanent immigration and emigration on estimates from N-mixture models, and to compare these effects among definitions of abundance (initial, season-long, and superpopulation). We also collected and analyzed point-count data on breeding bird species in the Great Basin (USA) to evaluate the fre­ quency of within-season movement. When detection probability was high (ρ ≥ 0.65), estimators of super­ population abundance from N-mixture and naïve models were relatively unbiased. By comparison, in many cases, even relatively small violations of the closure assumption biased estimates of initial and season-long abundance by {\textgreater} 20\%. Naïve abundance models generally were less biased than N-mixture models when ρ ≥ 0.65, but highly biased when ρ ≤ 0.4. In both model types, estimators of the association between abundance and an environmental covariate were minimally biased. The magnitudes of assumption violations tested in our simulations were consistent with those in our field data. Movement of individuals (availability) strongly affected detection probability of nearly all species and, in 7 of 34 species-region combinations, was temporally hetero­ geneous, suggesting that closure-assumption violations are common in our study system. Our results highlight that permanent movement of individuals within a season may be a substantial source of bias in studies of breeding birds that are based on count data, and that the definition of abundance affects the magnitude of these biases.},

	abstract = {Proliferation of redundant terms in ecology and conservation slows progress and creates confusion. ‘Countryside biogeography’ has been promoted as a new framework for conservation in production landscapes, so may offer a replacement for other concepts used by landscape ecologists. We conducted a systematic review to assess whether the 'countryside biogeography' concept provides a distinctive framing for conservation in human‐dominated landscapes relative to existing concepts. We reviewed 147 papers referring to countryside biogeography and 81 papers that did not. These papers were divided into categories representing three levels of use of countryside biogeography concepts (strong, weak, cited only) and two categories that did not use countryside biogeography at all but used similar concepts including fragmentation and matrix. We revealed few distinctions among groups of papers. Countryside biogeography papers made more frequent use of the terms 'ecosystem services', 'intensification' and 'land sparing' compared with non‐countryside biogeography papers. Papers that did not refer to countryside biogeography sampled production areas (e.g. farms) less often, and this related to their focus on habitat specialist species for which patch‐matrix assumptions were reasonable. Countryside biogeography offers a conceptual wrapper rather than a distinctive framework for advancing research in human‐modified landscapes. This and similar wrappers such as ‘conservation biogeography’ and ‘agricultural biogeography’ risk creating confusion among new researchers, and can prevent clear communication about research. To improve communication, we recommend using the suite of well‐established terms already applied to conservation in human‐modified landscapes rather than through an interceding conceptual wrapper.},

An appropriate measure to resolve these problems would be to introduce a flag of potentially threatened species within the Data Deficient category [i.e., DD(PT)]. Such a flag would represent a temporary Red List status for listed Data Deficient species that are, based on the available direct evidence and/or indirect indices, likely to be assigned to one of the threat categories, but where current data remains insufficient for a complete classification. The use of such a flag could increase the focus of the scientific community and conservation decision-makers on such species, thus avoiding the risk that necessary conservation measures are implemented too late. As such, establishment of the DD(PT) category as a kind of alarm for priority species could be beneficial.},

The selection of distribution data sets may therefore lead to variability in the spatial configuration and size of proposed reserve networks and uncertainty regarding the extent to which these networks actually contain the biodiversity features they were identified to protect. Our goals were to investigate the impact on reserve selection of choosing different distribution data sets and to propose novel methods to minimize uncertainty about target attainment within reserves. To do so, we used common prioritization methods (richness mapping, systematic reserve design, and a novel approach that integrates multiple types of distribution data) and three types of data on the distribution of mammals (predicted distribution models, occurrence records, and a novel combination of the two) to simulate the establishment of regional biodiversity reserves for the state of Arizona (U.S.A.). Using the results of these simulations, we explored variability in reserve placement and size as a function of the distribution data set. Spatial overlap of reserve networks identified with only predicted distribution data or only occurrence distribution data never exceeded 16\%. In pairwise comparisons between reserves created with all three types of distribution data, overlap never achieved 50\%. The reserve size required to meet conservation targets also varied with the type of distribution data used and the conservation goal; the largest reserve system was 10 times the smallest. Our results highlight the impact of employing different types of distribution data and identify novel tools for application to existing distribution data sets that can minimize uncertainty about target attainment.},

We combined projections from a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) that simulates the distributions of biomes based on basic plant functional types with projections from empirical climatic niche models for six tree species in northwestern North America. These integrated model outputs incorporate important biological processes, such as competition, physiological responses of plants to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and ﬁre, as well as what are likely to be species-speciﬁc climatic constraints. We compared the integrated projections to projections from the empirical climatic niche models alone. Overall, our integrated model outputs projected a greater climate-driven loss of potentially suitable environmental space than did the empirical climatic niche model outputs alone for the majority of modeled species. Our results also show that reﬁning species distributions with DGVM outputs had large effects on the geographic locations of suitable habitat. We demonstrate one approach to integrating the outputs of mechanistic and empirical niche models to produce bioclimatic projections. But perhaps more importantly, our study reveals the potential for empirical climatic niche models to over-predict suitable environmental space under future climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: Invasive alien species represent a growing threat for natural systems, economy and human health. Active surveillance and responses that readily suppress newly established colonies are effective actions to mitigate the noxious consequences of biological invasions. However, when an exotic species establishes a viable population in a new area, predicting its potential spread is the most effective way to implement adequate control actions. Emerging invasive species, despite monitoring efforts, are poorly known in terms of behaviour and capacity to adapt to the new invaded range. Therefore, tools that provide information on their spread by maximising the available data, are critical.
Methods: We apply three different approaches to model the potential distribution of an emerging invasive mosquito, Aedes koreicus, in Northeast Italy: 1) an automatic statistical approach based on information theory, 2) a statistical approach integrated with prior knowledge, and 3) a GIS physiology-based approach. Each approach possessed benefits and limitations, and the required ecological information increases on a scale from 1 to 3. We validated the model outputs using the only other known invaded area in Europe. Finally, we applied a road network analysis to the suitability surface with the highest prediction power to highlight those areas with the highest likelihood of invasion.
Results: The GIS physiological-based model had the highest prediction power. It showed that localities currently occupied by Aedes koreicus represent only a small fraction of the potentially suitable area. Furthermore, the modelled niche included areas as high as 1500 m a.s.l., only partially overlapping with Aedes albopictus distribution.
Conclusions: The simulated spread indicated that all of the suitable portion of the study area is at risk of invasion in a relatively short period of time if no control policies are implemented. Stochastic events may further boost the invasion process, whereas competition with Aedes albopictus may limit it. According to our analysis, some of the major cities in the study area may have already been invaded. Further monitoring is needed to confirm this finding. The developed models and maps represent valuable tools to inform policies aimed at eradicating or mitigating Aedes koreicus invasion in Northeast Italy and Central Europe.},

Results Integrated models estimated environmental relationships with greater precision and identiﬁed larger characteristic scales for environmental relationships than using presence–absence data alone. In addition, integrated models tended to have greater predictive performance, which was more robust to the amount of presence–absence and presence-only data used in modeling, than presence–absence and ensemble models.

	abstract = {Since the implementation of the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2003, deficiencies in SARA and its application have become clear. Legislative and policy inconsistencies among responsible federal agencies and the use of a subjective approach for prioritizing species protection lead to taxonomic biases in protection. Variations in legislation among provinces/territories and the reluctance of the federal government to take actions make SARA’s application often inefficient on nonfederally managed lands. Ambiguous key terms (e.g., critical habitat) and disregard for legislated deadlines in many steps impede the efficacy of SARA. Additionally, the failure to fully recognize Indigenous knowledge and to seek Indigenous cooperation in the species protection process leads to weaker government accountability, promotes inequity, and leads to missed opportunities for partnerships. New legislative amendments with well-defined and standardized steps, including an automatic listing process, a systematic prioritization program, and clearer demands (e.g., mandatory threshold to trigger safety net/emergency order) would improve the success of species at risk protection. Moreover, a more inclusive approach that brings Indigenous representatives and independent scientists together is necessary for improving SARA’s effectiveness. These changes have the potential to transform SARA into a more powerful act towards protecting Canada’s at-risk wildlife. (The graphical abstract follows.)},

	abstract = {Worldwide, migratory species are undergoing rapid declines but understanding the factors driving these declines is hindered by missing information about migratory connectivity and the lack of data to quantify environmental processes across the annual cycle. Here, we combined range-wide information about migratory connectivity with global remote-sensing data to quantify the relative importance of breeding and non-breeding environmental processes to persistent long-term population declines of a migratory songbird, the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Consistent with theoretical predictions about population limitation of migratory birds, our results suggest that habitat loss and climate have contributed to the observed declines in wood thrush breeding abundance, yet the relative importance of breeding versus non-breeding factors is population-specific. For example, high-abundance core breeding populations appear to be more limited by habitat loss, whereas low-abundance, peripheral populations appear to be limited by climate-driven seasonal interactions. Further, our analysis indicates that the relative impact of breeding habitat loss is at least three to six times greater than the impact of equivalent non-breeding habitat loss and therefore the steepest regional declines have likely been driven by the loss of breeding habitat. These results underscore the need for population-specific conservation strategies implemented throughout the annual cycle to reverse long-term declines.},

	abstract = {Population trends, defined as interval-specific proportional changes in population size, are often used to help identify species of conservation interest. Efficient modeling of such trends depends on the consideration of the correlation of population changes with key spatial and environmental covariates. This can provide insights into causal mechanisms and allow spatially explicit summaries at scales that are of interest to management agencies. We expand the hierarchical modeling framework used in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) by developing a spatially explicit model of temporal trend using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. By adopting a formal spatial model for abundance, we produce spatially explicit abundance and trend estimates. Analyses based on large-scale geographic strata such as Bird Conservation Regions (BCR) can suffer from basic imbalances in spatial sampling. Our approach addresses this issue by providing an explicit weighting based on the fundamental sample allocation unit of the BBS. We applied the spatial model to three species from the BBS. Species have been chosen based upon their well-known population change patterns, which allows us to evaluate the quality of our model and the biological meaning of our estimates. We also compare our results with the ones obtained for BCRs using a nonspatial hierarchical model (Sauer and Link 2011). Globally, estimates for mean trends are consistent between the two approaches but spatial estimates provide much more precise trend estimates in regions on the edges of species ranges that were poorly estimated in non-spatial analyses. Incorporating a spatial component in the analysis not only allows us to obtain relevant and biologically meaningful estimates for population trends, but also enables us to provide a flexible framework in order to obtain trend estimates for any area.},

	abstract = {Ecological data often exhibit spatial pattern, which can be modeled as autocorrelation. Conditional autoregressive (CAR) and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models are network-based models (also known as graphical models) specifically designed to model spatially autocorrelated data based on neighborhood relationships. We identify and discuss six different types of practical ecological inference using CAR and SAR models, including: (1) model selection, (2) spatial regression, (3) estimation of autocorrelation, (4) estimation of other connectivity parameters, (5) spatial prediction, and (6) spatial smoothing. We compare CAR and SAR models, showing their development and connection to partial correlations. Special cases, such as the intrinsic autoregressive model (IAR), are described. Conditional autoregressive and SAR models depend on weight matrices, whose practical development uses neighborhood definition and row-standardization. Weight matrices can also include ecological covariates and connectivity structures, which we emphasize, but have been rarely used. Trends in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in southeastern Alaska from 463 polygons, some with missing data, are used to illustrate the six inference types. We develop a variety of weight matrices and CAR and SAR spatial regression models are fit using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Profile likelihood graphs illustrate inference for covariance parameters. The same data set is used for both prediction and smoothing, and the relative merits of each are discussed. We show the nonstationary variances and correlations of a CAR model and demonstrate the effect of row-standardization. We include several take-home messages for CAR and SAR models, including (1) choosing between CAR and IAR models, (2) modeling ecological effects in the covariance matrix, (3) the appeal of spatial smoothing, and (4) how to handle isolated neighbors. We highlight several reasons why ecologists will want to make use of autoregressive models, both directly and in hierarchical models, and not only in explicit spatial settings, but also for more general connectivity models.},

	abstract = {One of the immediate responses to COVID-19 has been a call to ban wildlife trade given the suspected origin of the pandemic in a Chinese market selling and butchering wild animals. There is clearly an urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal, unsustainable or carries major risks to human health, biodiversity conservation or meeting acceptable animal welfare standards. However, some of the suggested actions in these calls go far beyond tackling these risks and have the potential to undermine human rights, damage conservation incentives and harm sustainable development. There are a number of reasons for this concerns. First calls for bans on wildlife markets often include calls for bans on wet markets, but the two are not the same thing, and wet markets can be a critical underpinning of informal food systems. Second, wildlife trade generates essential resources for the world’s most vulnerable people, contributing to food security for millions of people, particularly in developing countries. Third, wildlife trade bans have conservation risks including driving trade underground, making it even harder to regulate, and encouraging further livestock production. Fourth, in many cases, sustainable wildlife trade can provide key incentives for local people to actively protect species and the habitat they depend on, leading to population recoveries. Most importantly, a singular focus on wildlife trade overlooks the key driver of the emergence of infectious diseases: habitat destruction, largely driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation, and industrial livestock production. We suggest that the COVID-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity for a paradigm shift both in our global food system and also in our approach to conservation. We make speciﬁc suggestions as to what this entails, but the overriding principle is that local people must be at the heart of such policy shifts.},

We found that the AHC narrative elicited significantly greater pro-conservation policy support, especially for bans in the commercial trade of wildlife, when compared to the control group. Possible mechanisms driving this effect are that AHC narratives were less familiar, elicited higher mental and emotional engagement, and induced feelings that firms and governments are responsible for mitigating wildlife extinction.},

              Data sharing is one of the cornerstones of modern science that enables large-scale analyses and reproducibility. We evaluated data availability in research articles across nine disciplines in
              Nature
              and
              Science
              magazines and recorded corresponding authors’ concerns, requests and reasons for declining data sharing. Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders. These cross-discipline survey data are available from the plutoF repository.},

The technique is applicable at all densities of the target species. Perception bias (the proportion of groups of the target species that are visible in the transect yet missed by observers) is corrected for using a modified Petersen estimate calculated for each of 2 teams of 2 observers with 1 team on either side of the aircraft. Within a team, each observer reports their uncolluded observations into a separate track of a 2-track tape recorder, so that after the survey, each group can be characterized as being seen by only 1 (specified) or both members of the team. A correction factor is also suggested to standardize for the proportion of animals that are unavailable to observers because of water turbidity.},

	abstract = {We present an integrative statistical approach for estimating the current conditions of marine-bird habitats affected by human activities. We first estimated the influence of multiple human offshore activities on the species of interest using integrative regression techniques. We then used these models to predict the distribution and abundance of the species throughout the study area, in both the current situation, with human activities, and in a hypothetical situation without the effects of the studied human activities. We finally developed different mea­ sures related to the comparison between these two scenarios. The presented approach allows the integration of bird-count data from different sources and sampling schemes, thus maximizing the underlying database. It also provides a local metric highlighting critical regions where locally high abundance is co-localized with large declines in abundance due to human activities, as well as a global metric quantifying the overall condition of the marine-bird habitat in the study area in relation to human disturbance. This approach allows us to assess the cumulative influence of several anthropogenic pressures. We exemplarily applied the above approach to four different species and two different sea regions, namely European herring gulls and long-tailed ducks in the German section of the Baltic Sea, and European herring gulls, red-throated loons, and common murres in the German–Dutch–Belgian part of the North Sea. The considered activities were offshore wind farms, bottomtrawling fishery, and ship traffic. The results confirmed the avoidance of and attraction to human activities by marine bird species found in previous studies. These results show that the methods developed here can be used to provide indicators for inclusion in bird assessments under OSPAR and HELCOM conventions, and MSFD Article 8, criterion D1C5 (habitat for the species). The resulting indicator can be used to inform programmes of measures under MSFD Article 13.},

A large portion of the variability in. point counts is caused by the incomplete counting, and this within-count variation can be confounded with ecologically meaningful variation. We recommend caution in the analysis of estimates obtained from point counts. Using; our model, we also consider optimal allocation of sampling effort. The critical step in the optimization process is in determining the goals of the study and methods that will be used to meet these goals. By explicitly defining the constraints on sampling and by estimating the relationship between precision and bias of estimators and time spent counting, we can predict the optimal time at a point for each of several monitoring goals. In general, time spent at a point will differ depending on the goals of the study.},

	abstract = {Use of point-count surveys is a popular method for collecting data on abundance and distribution of birds. However, analyses of such data often ignore potential differences in detection probability. We adapted a removal model to directly estimate detection probability during point-count surveys. The model assumes that singing frequency is a major factor influencing probability of detection when birds are surveyed using point counts. This may be appropriate for surveys in which most detections are by sound. The model requires counts to be divided into several time intervals. Point counts are often conducted for 10 min, where the number of birds recorded is divided into those first observed in the first 3 min, the subsequent 2 min, and the last 5 min. We developed a maximum-likelihood estimator for the detectability of birds recorded during counts divided into those intervals. This technique can easily be adapted to point counts divided into intervals of any length. We applied this method to unlimited-radius counts conducted in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We used model selection criteria to identify whether detection probabilities varied among species, throughout the morning, throughout the season, and among different observers. We found differences in detection probability among species. Species that sing frequently such as Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) had high detection probabilities (-90\%) and species that call infrequently such as Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) had low detection probability (36\%). We also found detection probabilities varied with the time of day for some species (e.g. thrushes) and between observers for other species. We used the same approach to estimate detection probability and density for a subset of the observations with limited-radius point counts. Received 23 February 2000, accepted 9 October 2001.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of birds in a survey unit is partly determined by the habitat present. Moreover, some bird species preferentially avoid some land cover types and are attracted to others. As such, land cover composition within the 400 m survey areas along a Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) route clearly influences the species available to be detected. Ideally, to extend survey results to the larger landscape, land cover composition within the survey area should be similar to that at larger spatial extents defining the landscape. Such representativeness helps minimize possible roadside effects (bias), here defined as differences in bird species composition and abundance along a roadside as compared to a larger surrounding landscape. We used land cover data from the 2011 National Land Cover Database to examine representativeness of land cover composition along routes. Using ArcGIS, the percentages of each of 15 land cover types within 400 m buffers along 2,696 U.S. BBS routes were calculated and compared to percentages in 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km buffers surrounding each route. This assessment revealed that aquatic cover types and highly urbanized land tend to be slightly underrepresented in the survey areas. Two anthropogenic cover types (pasture/hay and cropland) may be slightly overrepresented in the survey areas. Over all cover types, 92\% of the 2,696 routes exhibited ‘‘good’’ representativeness, with ,5 percentage points per cover type difference in proportional cover between the 400 m and 10 km buffers. This assessment further supports previous research indicating that any land-cover-based roadside bias in the bird data of the BBS is likely minimal.},

Increases in vehicle counts were associated with decreases in bird counts in most of the species examined. The size and direction of these eﬀects remained relatively constant between two alternative models that we analyzed.

	abstract = {Conservation assessment is a rapidly evolving discipline whose stated goal is the design of networks of protected areas that represent and ensure the persistence of nature (i.e., species, habitats, and environmental processes) by separating priority areas from the activities that degrade or destroy them. Nevertheless, despite a burgeoning scientific literature that ever refines these techniques for allocating conservation resources, it is widely believed that conservation assessments are rarely translated into actions that actually conserve nature. We reviewed the conservation assessment literature in peer-reviewed journals and conducted survey questionnaires of the authors of these studies. Two-thirds of conservation assessments published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature do not deliver conservation action, primarily because most researchers never plan for implementation. This research–implementation gap between conservation science and real-world action is a genuine phenomenon and is a specific example of the "knowing–doing gap" that is widely recognized in management science. Given the woefully inadequate resources allocated for conservation, our findings raise questions over the utility of conservation assessment science, as currently practiced, to provide useful, pragmatic solutions to conservation planning problems. A reevaluation of the conceptual and operational basis of conservation planning research is urgently required. We recommend the following actions for beginning a process for bridging the research–implementation gap in conservation planning: (1) acknowledge the research–implementation gap is real, (2) source research questions from practitioners, (3) situate research within a broader conservation planning model, (4) expand the social dimension of conservation assessments, (5) support conservation plans with transdisciplinary social learning institutions, (6) reward academics for societal engagement and implementation, and (7) train students in skills for “doing” conservation.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that there is a considerable gap between the science of conservation biology and the design and execution of biodiversity conservation projects in the ﬁeld and science is failing to inform the practice of conservation. There are many reasons why this implementation gap exists. A high proportion of papers published in scientiﬁc journals by conservation biologists are seldom read outside of the academic world and there are few incentives for academics to convert their science into practice. In turn, ﬁeld practitioners rarely document their ﬁeld experiences and experiments in a manner that can meaningfully inform conservation scientists. Issues related to access to scientiﬁc literature, scientiﬁc relevance in multidisciplinary environments, donor expectations and a lack of critical analysis at all levels of conservation theory and practice are factors that exacerbate the divide. The contexts in which conservation biologists and ﬁeld practitioners operate are also often highly dissimilar, and each has differing professional responsibilities and expectations that compromise the ability to learn from each other’s expertise. Building on recent debate in the literature, and using case studies to illustrate the issues that characterize the divide, this paper draws on the authors’ experiences of project management as well as academic research. We identify ﬁve key issues related to information exchange: access to scientiﬁc literature, levels of scientiﬁc literacy, lack of interdisciplinarity, questions of relevance and lack of sharing of conservation-related experiences and suggest new ways of working that could assist in bridging the gap between conservation scientists and ﬁeld practitioners.},

We connect the rich, ongoing discussion about the vital role of the conservation social sciences to the specific context of bird conservation and make an argument for the importance of proactive inclusion of these sciences in ornithological societies. First, we introduce the conservation social sciences and illustrate how they can improve the design and implementation of conservation programs and policies for birds. Drawing on discussions from a symposium we organized at the 2019 American Ornithological Society (AOS) annual meeting, we encourage the AOS to make institutional changes that could further support the inclusion of conservation social sciences. These changes ideally would include a working group, conference plenaries and themes, and high-quality social science publications, along with support and encouragement for ornithologists and bird conservationists to partake in trainings and collaborate with social scientists. Strategies for how to do so effectively can be adapted from other conservation societies that have paved the way for disciplinary inclusivity.},

	abstract = {The recognized gap between research and implementation in avian conservation can be overcome with translational ecology, an intentional approach in which science producers and users from multiple disciplines work collaboratively to co-develop and deliver ecological research that addresses management and conservation issues. Avian conservation naturally lends itself to translational ecology because birds are well studied, typically widespread, often exhibit migratory behaviors transcending geopolitical boundaries, and necessitate coordinated conservation efforts to accommodate resource and habitat needs across the full annual cycle. In this perspective, we highlight several case studies from bird conservation practitioners and the ornithological and conservation social sciences exemplifying the 6 core translational ecology principles introduced in previous studies: collaboration, engagement, commitment, communication, process, and decision-framing. We demonstrate that following translational approaches can lead to improved conservation decision-making and delivery of outcomes via co-development of research and products that are accessible to broader audiences and applicable to specific management decisions (e.g., policy briefs and decision-support tools). We also identify key challenges faced during scientific producer–user engagement, potential tactics for overcoming these challenges, and lessons learned for overcoming the research-implementation gap. Finally, we recommend strategies for building a stronger translational ecology culture to further improve the integration of these principles into avian conservation decisions. By embracing translational ecology, avian conservationists and ornithologists can be well positioned to ensure that future management decisions are scientifically informed and that scientific research is sufficiently relevant to managers. Ultimately, such teamwork can help close the research-implementation gap in the conservation sciences during a time when environmental issues are threatening avian communities and their habitats at exceptional rates and at broadening spatial scales worldwide.},

This paper examines the scope and purpose of eighteen subﬁelds of classic, interdisciplinary and applied conservation social sciences and articulates ten distinct contributions that the social sciences can make to understanding and improving conservation. In brief, the conservation social sciences can be valuable to conservation for descriptive, diagnostic, disruptive, reﬂexive, generative, innovative, or instrumental reasons.

Citizen science surveys have provided good evidence of biodiversity declines whilst engaging people with them. Citizen scientists are also collecting opportunistic biodiversity records at unprecedented scales, vastly outnumbering records gathered through structured surveys. Opportunistic records exhibit spatio-temporal biases and heterogeneity in observer effort and skill, but their quantity offers a rich source of information. Data integration, the combination of multiple information sources in a common analytical framework, can potentially improve inferences about populations compared to analysing either in isolation. We combine count data from a structured citizen science survey and detection-nondetection data from an opportunistic citizen science programme. Population trends were modelled using dynamic N-mixture models to integrate both data sources. We applied this approach to two different inferential challenges arising from sparse data: (i) the estimation of population trends for an area smaller than a structured survey stratum, and (ii) the estimation of national population trends for a rare but widespread species. In both cases, data integration yielded population trajectories similar to those estimated from structured survey data alone but had higher precision when the density of opportunistic records was high. In some cases this allowed inferences about population trends where indices derived from single data sources were too uncertain to assess change. However, there were differences in the trend magnitude between the integrated and the standard survey model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We show that data integration of large-scale structured and unstructured data is feasible and offers potential to improve national and regional wildlife trend estimates, although a need to independently validate trends remains. Smaller gains are achieved in areas where uptake of opportunistic recording is low. The integration of opportunistic records from volunteer-selected locations alone may therefore not adequately address monitoring gaps for management and policy applications. To achieve the latter, scheme organisers should consider providing incentives for achieving representative coverage of target areas in both structured and unstructured recording schemes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Structured biodiversity monitoring programmes have been shown to track population trends reliably, but require large financial and time investment. The data assembled in a large and growing number of online databases are less structured and suffer from bias, but the number of observations is much higher compared to structured monitoring programmes. Model-based integration of data from these disparate sources could capitalize on their respective strengths. Location Germany. Methods Abundance data for 26 farmland bird species were gathered from the standardized Common Breeding Bird Survey (CBBS) and three online databases that varied with regard to their degree of survey standardization. Population trends were estimated with a benchmark model that included only CBBS data, and five Bayesian hierarchical models integrating all data sources in different combinations. Across models, we compared consistency and precision of the predicted population trends and the accuracy of the models. Bird species body mass, prevalence in the dataset and abundance were tested as potential predictors of the explored quantities. Results Consistency in predicted annual abundance indices was generally high especially when comparing the benchmark models to the integrated models without unstructured data. The accuracy of the estimated population changes was higher in the hierarchical models compared to the benchmark model but this was not related to data integration. Precision of the predicted population trends increased as more data sources were integrated. Main conclusions Model-based integration of data from different sources can lead to improved precision of bird population trend estimates. This opens up new opportunities for conservation managers to identify declining populations earlier. Integrating data from online databases could substantially increase sample size and thus allowing to derive trends for currently not well-monitored species, especially at sub-national scales.},

            Standardized monitoring is critical for conservation because reliable survey data are used to inform the necessity, type, and effectiveness of conservation actions. Many of the avian monitoring data used for conservation are collected by “comprehensive” programs that survey for all species observed; however, there are some species that have low availability for detection during comprehensive surveys and are instead monitored with targeted programs. Unfortunately, those targeted programs are rarely evaluated relative to existing programs and management objectives to inform allocation of effort. We assessed the statistical performance of the comprehensive North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), the targeted Canadian Nightjar Survey (CNS), and the two programs combined for the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor). First, we used parameters from the existing datasets to simulate population declines and determined the probability of detecting those declines. Analyses that combined both datasets resulted in higher probability of detecting a 30\% population decline (BBS: 38\%, CNS: 64\%, combined: 69\%). Next, we built probability of occurrence models and assessed the predictive performance of those models. Combined analyses had similar predictive performance to the CNS and moderated poor performance of the BBS in the north (mean Cohen’s kappa; BBS: 0.40, CNS: 0.46, combined: 0.50). Our results suggest that data from targeted monitoring is important for evaluation of Common Nighthawk population trend and habitat relationships but is best combined with BBS data. Comprehensive and targeted monitoring programs may be better when considered together, and exploration of data combination should become the rule, not the exception. We suggest that the framework we present can be used as a starting point for evaluating targeted monitoring programs relative to defined objectives and existing programs, with the potential to explore hypothetical management scenarios.},

Such shifts in behaviours, including travel patterns, consumerism, and energy use, are variously impacting biodiversity during the human-dominated geological epoch known as the Anthropocene. Indeed, the dramatic reduction in human mobility and activity has been termed the “Anthropause”. COVID-19 has highlighted the current environmental and biodiversity crisis and has provided an opportunity to redeﬁne our relationship with nature. Here we share 10 considerations for conservation policy makers to support and rethink the development of impactful and effective policies in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are opportunities to leverage societal changes as a result of COVID-19, focus on the need for collaboration and engagement, and address lessons learned through the development of policies (including those related to public health) during the pandemic. The pandemic has had devastating impacts on humanity that should not be understated, but it is also a warning that we need to redeﬁne our relationship with nature and restore biodiversity.

	abstract = {Lake whiteﬁsh (Coregonus clupeaformis) are an ecologically, economically, and culturally important species to the native and non-native ﬁshers of Lake Huron, Canada. Studying the effects of anthropogenic activity on lake whiteﬁsh is of utmost importance to ensure this species remains viable in its environment for sustainable harvest. One analysis tool that is frequently used for ecological population risk assessments are agent-based models (ABMs), in which the population is represented as a network of heterogeneous individual agents that interact with one another and their environment. However, in an ABM that incorporates a high level of biological detail to model a large population moving within a spatial environment over time, signiﬁcant computation is required to manage, manipulate, and store the relevant data for each agent over successive time iterations. We introduce a new approach to ABMs known as environmental ABMs (enviro-ABMs) to reduce this computational expense and simulation runtime. Speciﬁcally, we divide the environment into a collection of spatially indexed cells and treat each of these as a single agent, allowing ﬁsh to move from one contiguous cell to another. This reduces the computational requirements to a limited number of active cells. In addition to more predictable computational requirements, this method keeps all ﬁsh sorted by age and location for efﬁcient mortality, spawning, and harvest operations, and reduces the amount of computational overhead needed. Applying the enviro-ABM to our case study in Lake Huron, we demonstrate how it can be used to model anthropogenic activities and stressors that may affect lake whiteﬁsh, and how the model can be used to facilitate ﬁsheries management decision making. While the model is applied speciﬁcally to the case of whiteﬁsh in Lake Huron, it can be generalized to conduct risk assessment for other species in a variety of habitats.},

The link between song and quality comes about because the brain structures underlying song learning largely develop during the ﬁrst few months post-hatching. During this same period, songbirds are likely to be subject to nutritional and other stresses. Only individuals faring well in the face of stress are able to invest the resources in brain development necessary to optimize song learning. Learned features of song thus become reliable indicators of male quality, with reliability maintained by the developmental costs of song. We review the background and assumptions of the nutritional stress hypothesis, and present new experimental data demonstrating an eﬀect of nestling nutrition on nestling growth, brain development, and song learning, providing support for a key prediction of the hypothesis.},

To determine factors that aﬀect the incidence of these errors, we built an Internet-based survey that simulated avian point counts, and measured error rates among volunteer observers. Using similar-sounding vocalizations from paired rare and common bird species, we measured the eﬀects of species rarity and observer skill, and the inﬂuence of a reward system that explicitly encouraged the detection of rare species. Higher self-reported skill levels and common species independently predicted fewer nondetections (probability range: . [experts, common species] to . [moderates, rare species]). Overall proportions of detections that were false positives increased signiﬁcantly as skill level declined (range: . [experts, common species] to . [moderates, rare species]). Moderately skilled observers were signiﬁcantly more likely to report false-positive records of common species than of rare species, whereas experts were signiﬁcantly more likely to report false-positives of rare species than of common species. The reward for correctly detecting rare species did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect these patterns. Because false positives can also result from observers overestimating their own abilities (“overconﬁdence”), we lastly tested whether observers’ beliefs that they had recorded error-free data (“conﬁdence”) tended to be incorrect (“overconﬁdent”), and whether this pattern varied with skill. Observer conﬁdence increased signiﬁcantly with observer skill, whereas overconﬁdence was uniformly high (overall mean proportion = .). Our results emphasize the value of controlling for observer skill in data collection and modeling and do not support the use of opinion-based (i.e., subjective) indications of observer conﬁdence.

	abstract = {Point counts are one of the most common ways of collecting data to determine the relative abundance of birds. Many studies and monitoring programs, including the North American Breeding Bird Survey, use relative differences in counts of birds to assess changes in abundance over time and space. Many factors influence whether relative differences in counts of birds between various environmental conditions are reflective of actual differences in bird density. A major assumption of relative abundance is that birds with different song frequencies and amplitudes are heard at the same distances in different environmental conditions. We compared sound transmission in forest habitats and along low-use forestry roads, and calculated detection radius for different species to test the assumption that differences in bird counts between forest interior and roadside locations reflect actual differences in bird abundance. A playback–recording experiment was used to broadcast sounds through forest interior, along a forest edge, and down forestry roads in conifer and deciduous forests to determine whether sound propagation differed across environments. Sound attenuated significantly faster in forests than along roads or forest edges. Similarly, the distance at which bird songs could be detected was significantly shorter in forest than along the road or forest edge for 20 of 25 species. We found the area surveyed to be up to twice as large on road compared to within forests, which suggests that roadside surveys might inflate avian density estimates in comparison to off-road counts. Local atmospheric conditions also influenced detection probability, but the magnitude of the effect was weaker than the land-cover effect. Major differences in detection between roads and interior forest suggest that comparisons of surveys conducted along roadsides and in forest areas should be done carefully if the goal is to make direct comparisons of abundance.},

	abstract = {Distance sampling is widely used to estimate animal population densities by accounting for imperfect detection of individuals with increasing distance from an observer. Distance sampling assumes that distances are measured without error; however, it is often applied to human estimated distances, which are known to be inconsistent, inaccurate, and biased. We present an objective technique for estimating distance to vocalizing individuals that relies on the relative sound level (RSL) of the vocalization extracted from autonomous recording unit (ARU) recordings and show the error is less than human estimated error extracted from a literature case study. RSL predicted distances can be obtained by manual measurement in sound viewing software, or automatically with automated signal recognition software. We built calibration datasets of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) recorded at known distances and used regression of RSL from those recordings to predict distance. There was no error bias of RSL predicted distances when compared to known distances for Common Nighthawk, minimal error bias for Ovenbird, and error from all RSL predicted distances was less than human estimated error extracted from the literature. We then simulated ARU point count surveys with a known density and estimated that density with distance sampling to test whether RSL distance prediction does not violate the assumption that distances are measured without error. There was no difference in density estimates from known distance and density estimates obtained from RSL predicted distance, while density estimates contaminated with human estimated error were signiﬁcantly lower than density estimates from known distance. We found that a calibration dataset of approximately 300 vocalizations was suitable to minimize error for both species, and so conclude that RSL distance prediction is an accessible method of improving distance estimates relative to human estimation. We provide general recommendations on how to collect calibration recordings for the application of RSL distance prediction to other species and areas.},

	abstract = {Point counts are one of the most commonly used methods for assessing bird abundance. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being used as a replacement for human-based point counts. Previous studies have compared the relative benefits of human versus ARU-based point count methods, primarily with the goal of understanding differences in species richness and the abundance of individuals over an unlimited distance. What has not been done is an evaluation of how to standardize these two types of data so that they can be compared in the same analysis, especially when there are differences in the area sampled. We compared detection distances between human observers in the field and four commercially available recording devices (Wildlife Acoustics SM2, SM3, RiverForks, and Zoom H1) by simulating vocalizations of various avian species at different distances and amplitudes. We also investigated the relationship between sound amplitude and detection to simplify ARU calibration. We used these data to calculate correction factors that can be used to standardize detection distances of ARUs relative to each other and human observers. In general, humans in the field could detect sounds at greater distances than an ARU although detectability varied depending on species song characteristics. We provide correction factors for four commonly used ARUs and propose methods for calibrating ARUs relative to each other and human observers.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly deﬁned. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher’s information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto ﬁtted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of ﬁt or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the ﬁt and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justiﬁcation. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

	abstract = {Estimating the population abundance of landbirds is a challenging task complicated by the amount, type, and quality of available data. Avian conservationists have relied on population estimates from Partners in Flight (PIF), which primarily uses roadside data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). However, the BBS was not designed to estimate population sizes. Therefore, we set out to compare the PIF approach with spatially explicit models incorporating roadside and off-road point-count surveys. We calculated population estimates for 81 landbird species in Bird Conservation Region 6 in Alberta, Canada, using land cover and climate as predictors. We also developed a framework to evaluate how the differences between the detection distance, time-of-day, roadside count, and habitat representation adjustments explain discrepancies between the 2 estimators. We showed that the key assumptions of the PIF population estimator were commonly violated in this region, and that the 2 approaches provided different population estimates for most species. The average differences between estimators were explained by differences in the detection-distance and timeof-day components, but these adjustments left much unexplained variation among species. Differences in the roadside count and habitat representation components explained most of the among-species variation. The variation caused by these factors was large enough to change the population ranking of the species. The roadside count bias needs serious attention when roadside surveys are used to extrapolate over off-road areas. Habitat representation bias is likely prevalent in regions sparsely and non-representatively sampled by roadside surveys, such as the boreal region of North America, and thus population estimates for these regions need to be treated with caution for certain species. Additional sampling and integrated modeling of available data sources can contribute towards more accurate population estimates for conservation in remote areas of North America.},

They combined information about a bird species availability (i.e., whether it gives a cue that it is there) and perceptibility (i.e., whether an observer observes a cue), and use that information as an offset. These offsets can be used within a single data set to correct for detectability biases and transform data into estimates of true abundance or true density. Alternatively, these offsets SHOULD be able to be used to integrate data within a single modelling framework, as you can get all data speaking the same language of true abundnace (rather than abundance GIVEN survey type).},
	annote = {This is the first of a series of paper that uses the QPAD detectability offset. QPAD combines estimate of a birds' singing rate \${\textbackslash}phi\$ which is estimated using removal modelling, a birds' effective detection radius \${\textbackslash}tau\$ which is estimated using distance sampling, and infomration about the survey area. Here, they chose to model \${\textbackslash}phi\$ by a number of combinations of Julian Day and Time-since-Local-sunrise, and they chose to model \${\textbackslash}tau\$ by proportion of tree cover and land cover class. This reformatulion of removal and distance modelling allows for the estimation of avian density across point-count surveys that vary in survey duration, survey radius, and any intervals of those. One of the novel components of this paper is the fact that they were able to estimate availability *p* and perceptability *q* independently, therefore allowing the use of covariates to predict them. This offset approach has several potential benefits to be used, namely 1) it can be used to generate estimates of density for bird species, rather than abundance, and 2) it can be used to allow different data sets to speak the same "language" as the different data sets, once offset by QPAD, will both be giving density, accounting for differences in survey type. The authors warn of some potential biased estimation using QPAD for species that move at high rates (see Scott \& Ramsey 1981; Burnham et al 2004:352-356), move in response to observers (see Buckland et al 2001), or sing in irregular bouts or at low rates (see Alldredge et al 2007b).},

Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

	abstract = {When replicate count data are overdispersed, it is common practice to incorporate this extra-Poisson variability by including latent parameters at the observation level. For example, the negative binomial and Poisson-lognormal (PLN) models are obtained by using gamma and lognormal latent parameters, respectively. Several recent publications have employed the deviance information criterion (DIC) to choose between these two models, with the deviance deﬁned using the Poisson likelihood that is obtained from conditioning on these latent parameters. The results herein show that this use of DIC is inappropriate. Instead, DIC was seen to perform well if calculated using likelihood that was marginalized at the group level by integrating out the observation-level latent parameters. This group-level marginalization is explicit in the case of the negative binomial, but requires numerical integration for the PLN model. Similarly, DIC performed well to judge whether zero inﬂation was required when calculated using the group-marginalized form of the zero-inﬂated likelihood. In the context of comparing multilevel hierarchical models, the top-level DIC was obtained using likelihood that was further marginalized by additional integration over the group-level latent parameters, and the marginal densities of the models were calculated for the purpose of providing Bayes’ factors. The computational viability and interpretability of these diﬀerent measures is considered.},

Taking advantage of the well-known relationship between the Wald and log likelihood ratio test statistics, we propose a complete-data log likelihood ratio based procedure. It is shown that, for any number of multiple imputations, the proposed procedure is equivalent in large samples to the existing procedure based on the point estimates and the variance-covariance matrices, yet it only requires the point estimates and evaluations of the complete-data log likelihood ratio statistic as a function of these estimates and the completed data. The proposed procedure, therefore, is especially attractive with highly multiparameter incomplete-data problems since it does not involve the computation of any matrices.},

Although flexible modelling of multivariate point-referenced data has recently been addressed by using a linear model of co-regionalization, existing methods for multivariate areal data typically suffer from unnecessary restrictions on the covariance structure or undesirable dependence on the conditioning order of the variables. We propose a class of Bayesian hierarchical models for multivariate areal data that avoids these restrictions, permitting flexible and order-free modelling of correlations both between variables and across areal units. Our framework encompasses a rich class of multivariate conditionally autoregressive models that are computationally feasible via modern Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the strengths of our approach over existing models by using simulation studies and also offer a real data application involving annual lung, larynx and oesophageal cancer death-rates in Minnesota counties between 1990 and 2000.},

The distribution of species abundances is fundamental to numerous longstanding questions in ecology, yet the empirical pattern at the global scale remains unresolved, with a few species’ abundance well known but most poorly characterized. In large part because of heterogeneous data, few methods exist that can scale up to all species across the globe. Here, we integrate data from a suite of well-studied species with a global dataset of bird occurrences throughout the world—for 9,700 species (∼92\% of all extant species)—and use missing data theory to estimate species-specific abundances with associated uncertainty. We find strong evidence that the distribution of species abundances is log left skewed: there are many rare species and comparatively few common species. By aggregating the species-level estimates, we find that there are ∼50 billion individual birds in the world at present. The global-scale abundance estimates that we provide will allow for a line of inquiry into the structure of abundance across biogeographic realms and feeding guilds as well as the consequences of life history (e.g., body size, range size) on population dynamics. Importantly, our method is repeatable and scalable: as data quantity and quality increase, our accuracy in tracking temporal changes in global biodiversity will increase. Moreover, we provide the methodological blueprint for quantifying species-specific abundance, along with uncertainty, for any organism in the world.},

Amid our growing understanding of how species’ distributions will respond to climate change, conservation scientists need to plan for connectivity conservation across entire continents. We modeled multi-scale connectivity priorities based on the least human-modified lands between large protected areas of North America using least-cost and circuit theory approaches. We first identified priority corridors between large protected areas, then characterized the network’s structure to unveil priority linkages most important for maintaining network and regional-level connectivity. Agreement between least-cost corridors and current flow varied throughout North America, reflecting permeable landscape conditions and ‘pinch points’ where potential ecological flows may concentrate between protected areas. Priority network-level linkages derived from each approach were similar throughout the continental network (e.g., Rocky Mountains and Canadian boreal), but critical linkages that bridged regional protected area networks varied. We emphasize the importance of planning for connectivity at continental scales and demonstrate the utility of multiple methods when mapping connectivity priorities across large spatial extents with wide gradients in landscape conditions.},

	abstract = {Increased agricultural production through both intensification and extensification is a major driver of the current biodiversity crisis. As a response, two contrasting approaches have been advocated: ‘land sparing’, which min­ imizes demand for farmland by increasing yield, and ‘land sharing’, which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but decreases agricultural yields. While these approaches have been useful in drawing attention to the impact of meeting the growing global demand for agricultural products on biodiversity, they have been driven mainly by conservation ecologists, and have often overlooked important issues related to farming. As agricultural scientists with practical experience in developing, testing and scaling alternative forms of agriculture in some of the most biodiversity-rich areas of Latin America, Eastern and Southern Africa and South Asia, we are pointing in this paper at what we see as being two major limitations of the land sparing/sharing framework: (1) the reliance on yield-density relationships that focus on trade-offs and overlook synergies between agriculture and biodi­ versity, and (2) the overemphasis on crop yield, neglecting other metrics of agricultural performance which may be more important to local farmers, and more strongly associated with positive biodiversity outcomes. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate other agricultural scientists to contribute to the land sparing/sharing framework, in order to develop together with conservation ecologists viable solutions for both improved agri­ cultural production and biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {A framework is presented for understanding how misinformation shapes decision-making, which has cognitive representations of gist at its core. I discuss how the framework goes beyond prior work, and how it can be implemented so that valid scientific messages are more likely to be effective, remembered, and shared through social media, while misinformation is resisted. The distinction between mental representations of the rote facts of a message—its verbatim representation—and its gist explains several paradoxes, including the frequent disconnect between knowing facts and, yet, making decisions that seem contrary to those facts. Decision makers can falsely remember the gist as seen or heard even when they remember verbatim facts. Indeed, misinformation can be more compelling than information when it provides an interpretation of reality that makes better sense than the facts. Consequently, for many issues, scientific information and misinformation are in a battle for the gist. A fuzzy-processing preference for simple gist explains expectations for antibiotics, the spread of misinformation about vaccination, and responses to messages about global warming, nuclear proliferation, and natural disasters. The gist, which reflects knowledge and experience, induces emotions and brings to mind social values. However, changing mental representations is not sufficient by itself; gist representations must be connected to values. The policy choice is not simply between constraining behavior or persuasion—there is another option. Science communication needs to shift from an emphasis on disseminating rote facts to achieving insight, retaining its integrity but without shying away from emotions and values.},

	abstract = {The current loss of biodiversity has been broadly acknowledged as the main cause of ecosystem change. To halt this trend, several international agreements have been made, and various biodiversity metrics have been developed to evaluate whether the targets of these agreements are being met. The process of developing good indicators is not trivial. Indicators should be able to synthesize and communicate our current knowledge, but they also need to meet both scientific and practical criteria. Since it would not be practical to monitor all species, indicators are mainly built on the monitoring of some well-known taxa, such as birds. Here we systematically review the wide spectrum of bird biodiversity indicators (hereafter indicators) available to: i) evaluate recent methodological advances; ii) identify current knowledge gaps jeopardizing indicator interpretation and use in guiding decision-making; and iii) examine challenges in their applicability across different spatial and temporal contexts. We pay particular attention to indicator characteristics such as site and species selection, spatial, seasonal and habitat coverage, and statistical issues in developing indicators and tools to tackle them, to provide specific recommendations for the future construction of indicators. Several methodological advances have recently been made to enhance the process of indicator development, including multiple ways to select sites and species to increase their robustness. However, we found that there are strong spatial, seasonal and habitat biases among the selected indicators. Most of them are from Europe, using mainly census data from the breeding season and typically covering farmland and forest habitats. The major challenges that we detected in their applicability were related to the modelling of the statistical uncertainty associated to the indicator. We recommend the use of quantitative methods in site and species selection procedures whenever possible. Current indicators should be expanded to areas outside Europe and to less studied habitats and should not neglect monitoring work outside the breeding season. Time-series analyses studying temporal trends and using multi-species data should in general account for temporal autocorrelation as well as for phylogenetic correlation. Multi-species hierarchical models are a good alternative for analysing and constructing indicators, but they need to include annual random effects allowing for unexplained annual variation in the average status of the community, i.e. the indicator target. Despite methodological and context-specific differences in the indicators reviewed, most of them seem to highlight the urgent need of devising strategic climate and conservation policies to improve the status and trends of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Selecting among competing statistical models is a core challenge in science. However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterns in biological communities are typically driven by environmental factors and species interactions. Spatial data from communities are naturally described by stacking models for all species in the community. Two important considerations in such multispecies or joint species distribution models (JSDMs) are measurement errors and correlations between species. Up to now, virtually all JSDMs have included either one or the other, but not both features simultaneously, even though both measurement errors and species correlations may be essential for achieving unbiased inferences about the distribution of communities and species co-occurrence patterns. We developed two presence–absence JSDMs for modeling pairwise species correlations while accommodating imperfect detection: one using a latent variable and the other using a multivariate probit approach. We conducted three simulation studies to assess the performance of our new models and to compare them to earlier latent variable JSDMs that did not consider imperfect detection. We illustrate our models with a large Atlas data set of 62 passerine bird species in Switzerland. Under a wide range of conditions, our new latent variable JSDM with imperfect detection and species correlations yielded estimates with little or no bias for occupancy, occupancy regression coefficients, and the species correlation matrix. In contrast, with the multivariate probit model we saw convergence issues with large data sets (many species and sites) resulting in very long run times and larger errors. A latent variable model that ignores imperfect detection produced correlation estimates that were consistently negatively biased, that is, underestimated. We found that the number of latent variables required to represent the species correlation matrix adequately may be much greater than previously suggested, namely around n/2, where n is community size. The analysis of the Swiss passerine data set exemplifies how not accounting for imperfect detection will lead to negative bias in occupancy estimates and to attenuation in the estimated covariate coefficients in a JSDM. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity in detection may cause spurious patterns in the estimated species correlation matrix if not accounted for. Our new JSDMs represent an important extension of current approaches to community modeling to the common case where species presence–absence cannot be detected with certainty.},

	abstract = {Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimates of population abundance are essential to both theoretical and applied ecology. Rarely are all individuals detected during a survey and abundance models often incorporate some form of imperfect detection. Detection probability, however, consists of three components: probability of presence during a survey, probability of availability given presence, and probability of detection given availability and presence. We develop an integrated model to separate these three detection components and provide abundance estimates for the available, present, and superpopulation of individuals. Our framework integrates several common survey methods for unmarked populations: spatially and temporally replicated counts, distance sampling data, and time-of-detection data. Simulations indicated relatively unbiased estimates for detection and availability probabilities. Negative bias in estimated superpopulation abundance was present with three temporally replicated surveys, but greatly reduced with six surveys. In a case study of Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), posterior modes for presence, availability, and detection probabilities were 0.78, 0.96, and 0.26, respectively, from 10-min point counts repeated at 97 sites on three occasions, with noticeable differences among available, present, and superpopulation abundance estimates. This generalizable framework integrates common sampling protocols and provides joint inferences on the components of detection probability, spatial and non-spatial temporary emigration, and abundance in unmarked populations.},

	abstract = {Long-term wildlife monitoring involves collecting time series data, often using the same observers over multiple years. Aging-related changes to these observers may be an important, under-recognized source of error that can bias management decisions. In this study, we used data from two large, independent bird surveys, the Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Ontario (“OBBA”) and the North American Breeding Bird Survey (“BBS”), to test for age-related observer effects in long-term time series of avian presence and abundance. We then considered the effect of such aging phenomena on current population trend estimates. We found signiﬁcantly fewer detections among older versus younger observers for 13 of 43 OBBA species, and declines in detection as an observer ages for 4 of 6 vocalization groups comprising 59 of 64 BBS species. Consistent with hearing loss inﬂuencing this pattern, we also found evidence for increasingly severe detection declines with increasing call frequency among nine high-pitched bird species (OBBA); however, there were also detection declines at other frequencies, suggesting important additional effects of aging, independent of hearing loss. We lastly found subtle, signiﬁcant relationships between some species’ published population trend estimates and (1) their corresponding vocalization frequency (n ≥ 22 species) and (2) their estimated declines in detectability among older observers (n = 9 high-frequency, monotone species), suggesting that observer aging can negatively bias long-term monitoring data for some species in part through hearing loss effects. We recommend that survey designers and modelers account for observer age where possible.},

The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.},

Here, we discuss and illustrate model selection using leave-one-out cross validation, and the Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion (BPIC). Cross-validation is enormously computationally intensive; we thus evaluate the performance of the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) as a computationally efficient approximation to the BPIC. Our evaluation is based on analyses of 4 models as applied to 20 species covered by the BBS. Model selection based on BPIC provided no strong evidence of one model being consistently superior to the others; for 14/20 species, none of the models emerged as superior. For the remaining 6 species, a first-difference model of population trajectory was always among the best fitting. Our results show that WAIC is not reliable as a surrogate for BPIC. Development of appropriate model sets and their evaluation using BPIC is an important innovation for the analysis of BBS data.},

	abstract = {The vision of Chandler (Chan) S. Robbins for a continental-scale omnibus survey of breeding birds led to the development of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Chan was uniquely suited to develop the BBS. His position as a government scientist had given him experience with designing and implementing continental-scale surveys, his research background made him an effective advocate of the need for a survey to monitor pesticide effects on birds, and his prominence in the birding community gave him connections to infrastructure—a network of qualified volunteer birders who could conduct roadside surveys with standardized point counts. Having started in the eastern United States and the Atlantic provinces of Canada in 1966, the BBS now provides population change information for {\textasciitilde}546 species in the continental United States and Canada, and recently initiated routes in Mexico promise to greatly expand the areas and species covered by the survey. Although survey protocols have remained unchanged for 50 years, the BBS remains relevant in a changing world. Several papers that follow in this Special Section of The Condor: Ornithological Advances review how the BBS has been applied to conservation assessments, especially in combination with other large-scale survey data. A critical feature of the BBS program is an active research program into field and analytical methods to enhance the quality of the count data and to control for factors that influence detectability. Papers in the Special Section also present advances in BBS analyses that improve the utility of this expanding and sometimes controversial survey. In this Perspective, we introduce the Special Section by reviewing the history of the BBS, describing current analyses, and providing summary trend results for all species, highlighting 3 groups of conservation concern: grassland-breeding birds, aridland-breeding birds, and aerial insectivorous birds.},

	abstract = {The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) was established in 1966 in response to a lack of quantitative data on changes in the populations of many bird species at a continental scale, especially songbirds. The BBS now provides the most reliable regional and continental trends and annual indices of abundance available for .500 bird species. This paper reviews some of the ways in which BBS data have contributed to bird conservation in North America over the past 50 yr, and highlights future program enhancement opportunities. BBS data have contributed to the listing of species under the Canadian Species at Risk Act and, in a few cases, have informed species assessments under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. By raising awareness of population changes, the BBS has helped to motivate bird conservation efforts through the creation of Partners in Flight. BBS data have been used to determine priority species and locations for conservation action at regional and national scales through Bird Conservation Region strategies and Joint Ventures. Data from the BBS have provided the quantitative foundation for North American State of the Birds reports, and have informed the public with regard to environmental health through multiple indicators, such as the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Report on the Environment. BBS data have been analyzed with other data (e.g., environmental, land cover, and demographic) to evaluate potential drivers of population change, which have then informed conservation actions. In a few cases, BBS data have contributed to the evaluation of management actions, including informing the management of Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura), Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa), and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). Improving geographic coverage in northern Canada and in Mexico, improving the analytical approaches required to integrate data from other sources and to address variation in detectability, and completing the database, by adding historical bird data at each point count location and pinpointing the current point count locations would further enhance the survey’s value.},

	abstract = {Conservation resources are limited, and prioritizing species based on their relative vulnerability and risk of extinction is a fundamental component of conservation planning. In North America, the conservation consortium Partners in Flight (PIF) has developed and implemented a data-driven species assessment process, at global and regional scales, based on quantitative vulnerability criteria. This species assessment process has formed the biological basis for PIF’s continental and regional planning and has informed the ranking and legal listing of bird species for conservation protection by state, provincial, and national agencies in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. Because of its long time series, extensive geographic and species coverage, standardized survey methods, and prompt availability of results, the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) has been an invaluable source of data, allowing PIF to assign objective vulnerability scores calibrated across more than 460 landbird species. BBS data have been most valuable for assessing long-term population trends (PT score). PIF has also developed methods for estimating population size by extrapolating from BBS abundance indices, allowing the assignment of categorical population size (PS) scores for landbird species. At regional scales, BBS relative abundance indices have allowed PIF to assess the area importance (i.e. stewardship responsibility) of each Bird Conservation Region (BCR) for each species, using measures of both relative density and percent of total population in each BCR. Besides direct applicability to assessment scores, PIF has recently used BBS trend data to create new metrics of conservation urgency (e.g., ‘half-life’), as well as for setting population objectives for tracking progress toward meeting conservation goals. Future directions include integrating BBS data with other sources (e.g., eBird) to assess additional species and nonbreeding season measures, working closely with BBS coordinators to expand surveys into Mexico, and providing assessment scores at implementation-relevant scales, such as for migratory bird joint ventures.},

We combined data collected in 2005–2011 from 16,250 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) survey points with local and remotely sensed environmental data to model the distribution of 7 grassland bird species in the Northern Great Plains of the United States. We analyzed data at the survey point level, which is consistent with the scale of conservation treatments that we apply, and avoided information loss caused by pooling data at the BBS route level. By accounting for observer effects, nesting of survey points within routes, and sequence of survey points, we accommodated BBS survey design, refined estimates of important habitat predictors, improved model fit, and reduced or eliminated positive spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. The predictive power of models was greatly increased by including variables that characterized annual and long-term precipitation, as well as local land cover attributes not available from satellite-derived land cover data. Occurrence models from survey-point-level BBS data and environmental data with high thematic resolution were able to describe habitat relationships that are often associated with fine-grained, local studies, but across broad spatial extents and at scales relevant to local conservation actions. Predicted occurrence was strongly correlated with observed numbers, suggesting that occurrence models may be useful indicators of density. Relationships derived from models allowed us to develop spatially explicit decision support tools, which can be used to target areas for conservation treatments and to assess the conservation actions of multiple conservation programs and joint ventures (e.g., Prairie Pothole, Rainwater Basin, and Northern Great Plains joint ventures) in the U.S. Northern Great Plains.},

	abstract = {Systematic conservation planning aims to design networks of protected areas that meet conservation goals across large landscapes. The optimal design of these conservation networks is most frequently based on the modeled habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of species, despite evidence that model predictions may not be highly correlated with species density. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed using species density distributions more efficiently conserve populations of all species considered than networks designed using probability of occurrence models. To test this hypothesis, we used the Zonation conservation prioritization algorithm to evaluate conservation network designs based on probability of occurrence versus density models for 26 land bird species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We assessed the efficacy of each conservation network based on predicted species densities and predicted species diversity. High-density model Zonation rankings protected more individuals per species when networks protected the highest priority 10-40\% of the landscape. Compared with density-based models, the occurrence-based models protected more individuals in the lowest 50\% priority areas of the landscape. The 2 approaches conserved species diversity in similar ways: predicted diversity was higher in higher priority locations in both conservation networks. We conclude that both density and probability of occurrence models can be useful for setting conservation priorities but that density-based models are best suited for identifying the highest priority areas. Developing methods to aggregate species count data from unrelated monitoring efforts and making these data widely available through ecoinformatics portals such as the Avian Knowledge Network will enable species count data to be more widely incorporated into systematic conservation planning efforts.},

This is further a most relevant question from a practical viewpoint since the meaning of the number of components G is strongly related to the modelling purpose of a mixture distribution. We distinguish in this chapter between selecting G as a density estimation problem in Section 2 and selecting G in a model-based clustering framework in Section 3. Both sections discuss frequentist as well as Bayesian approaches. We present here some of the Bayesian solutions to the different interpretations of picking the "right" number of components in a mixture, before concluding on the ill-posed nature of the question.},

Birds, in particular, rely heavily on vocal communication and have recently been shown to change the structure of their signals in response to environmental noise. Our objective was to determine the impact of traffic noise on Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) song structure and song timing. We recorded bird songs using a directional microphone and installed permanent recording devices to monitor daily song patterns at both high traffic noise sites and low traffic noise sites throughout southern Ontario, Canada. Our results indicate that at sites with high traffic noise, Red-winged Blackbirds sing songs with fewer introductory syllables, which are an important component of individual recognition and repertoire formation. In addition, the typical diurnal singing pattern of birds associated with noisy urban sites is more homogeneous than that of birds associated with quiet rural marshes. In the early morning and evening, singing effort was higher at rural sites than at urban sites, while in the midday singing effort at urban sites was higher than at rural sites. Birds at our noisy urban sites appear to be avoiding acoustic masking by increasing song production during the quiet part of the day and decreasing song production during the noisy rush hour periods. Based on our results, urban noise is impacting communication structure and the daily pattern of song production in a marsh-nesting species. These results have important implications for avian conservation and land use planning for urban development.},

They are popular because they allow inference about N while controlling for factors that inﬂuence p without the need for marking animals. Using a capture–recapture perspective, we show that the loss of information that results from not marking animals is critical, making reliable statistical modeling of N and p problematic using just count data. One cannot reliably ﬁt a model in which the detection probabilities are distinct among repeat visits as this model is overspeciﬁed. This makes uncontrolled variation in p problematic. By counter example, we show that even if p is constant after adjusting for covariate eﬀects (the “constant p” assumption) scientiﬁcally plausible alternative models in which N (or its expectation) is non-identiﬁable or does not even exist as a parameter, lead to data that are practically indistinguishable from data generated under an N-mixture model. This is particularly the case for sparse data as is commonly seen in applications. We conclude that under the constant p assumption reliable inference is only possible for relative abundance in the absence of questionable and/or untestable assumptions or with better quality data than seen in typical applications. Relative abundance models for counts can be readily ﬁtted using Poisson regression in standard software such as R and are suﬃciently ﬂexible to allow controlling for p through the use covariates while simultaneously modeling variation in relative abundance. If users require estimates of absolute abundance, they should collect auxiliary data that help with estimation of p.},

	abstract = {Imperfect detection during animal surveys biases estimates of abundance and can lead to improper conclusions regarding distribution and population trends. Farnsworth et al. (2005) developed a combined distance-sampling and time-removal model for point-transect surveys that addresses both availability (the probability that an animal is available for detection; e.g., that a bird sings) and perceptibility (the probability that an observer detects an animal, given that it is available for detection). We developed a hierarchical extension of the combined model that provides an integrated analysis framework for a collection of survey points at which both distance from the observer and time of initial detection are recorded. Implemented in a Bayesian framework, this extension facilitates evaluating covariates on abundance and detection probability, incorporating excess zero counts (i.e. zero-inflation), accounting for spatial autocorrelation, and estimating population density. Species-specific characteristics, such as behavioral displays and territorial dispersion, may lead to different patterns of availability and perceptibility, which may, in turn, influence the performance of such hierarchical models. Therefore, we first test our proposed model using simulated data under different scenarios of availability and perceptibility. We then illustrate its performance with empirical point-transect data for a songbird that consistently produces loud, frequent, primarily auditory signals, the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla); and for 2 ptarmigan species (Lagopus spp.) that produce more intermittent, subtle, and primarily visual cues. Data were collected by multiple observers along point transects across a broad landscape in southwest Alaska, so we evaluated point-level covariates on perceptibility (observer and habitat), availability (date within season and time of day), and abundance (habitat, elevation, and slope), and included a nested point-withintransect and park-level effect. Our results suggest that this model can provide insight into the detection process during avian surveys and reduce bias in estimates of relative abundance but is best applied to surveys of species with greater availability (e.g., breeding songbirds).},

	abstract = {We used binomial distance-sampling models to estimate the effective detection radius (EDR) of point-count surveys across boreal Canada. We evaluated binomial models based on 0–50 m and {\textgreater}50 m distance categories for goodness-of-fit and sensitivities to variation in survey effort and habitats sampled. We also compared binomial EDRs to Partners in Flight’s maximum detection distances (MDD) to determine differences in landbird population sizes derived from each. Binomial EDRs had a small positive bias (4\%) averaged across 86 species and a large positive bias (30–82\%) for two species when compared with EDRs estimated using multinomial distance sampling. Patterns in binomial EDRs were consistent with how bird songs attenuate in relation to their frequencies and transmission through different habitats. EDR varied 12\% among habitats and increased 17\% when birds were counted to an unlimited distance, compared with a limited distance of 100 m. The EDR did not vary with the duration of surveys, and densities did not differ when using unlimited-distance versus truncated data. Estimated densities, however, increased 19\% from 3- to 5-min counts and 25\% from 5- to 10-min counts, possibly from increases in the availability, movement, or double counting of birds with longer counts. Thus, investigators should be cautious when comparing distance-sampling results among studies if methods vary. Population sizes estimated using EDR averaged 5 times (0.8–15 times) those estimated with MDD. Survey data from which to estimate binomial EDRs are widely available across North America and could be used as an alternative to MDD when estimating landbird population sizes.

	abstract = {An important metric for many aspects of species conservation planning and risk assessment is an estimate of total population size. For landbirds breeding in North America, Partners in Flight (PIF) generates global, continental, and regional population size estimates. These estimates are an important component of the PIF species assessment process, but have also been used by others for a range of applications. The PIF population size estimates are primarily calculated using a formula designed to extrapolate bird counts recorded by the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to regional population estimates. The extrapolation formula includes multiple assumptions and sources of uncertainty, but there were previously no attempts to quantify this uncertainty in the published population size estimates aside from a categorical data quality score. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we propagated the main sources of uncertainty arising from individual components of the model through to the final estimation of landbird population sizes. This approach results in distributions of population size estimates rather than point estimates. We found the width of uncertainty of population size estimates to be generally narrower than the order-of-magnitude distances between the population size score categories PIF uses in the species assessment process, suggesting confidence in the categorical ranking used by PIF. Our approach provides a means to identify species whose uncertainty bounds span more than one categorical rank, which was not previously possible with the data quality scores. Although there is still room for additional improvements to the estimation of avian population sizes and uncertainty, particularly with respect to replacing categorical model components with empirical estimates, our estimates of population size distributions have broader utility to a range of conservation planning and risk assessment activities relying on avian population size estimates.},

	abstract = {Conservation planning requires information at a variety of geographic scales, and it is often unclear whether surveys designed for other purposes will provide appropriate information for management at various scales. We evaluated the use of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to meet information needs for conservation planning in Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs). The BBS originally was developed to provide regional estimates for states, provinces, physiographic regions, and larger areas. Many analyses have used physiographic regions within states/provinces as strata. We evaluated potential consequences of using BCRs instead of the BBS physiographic regions, testing for spatial differences in sample intensity within states and provinces. We reclassified the BBS survey routes to BCRs and conducted route regression trend (interval-specific population change) analyses for a variety of regions and time intervals. Our results were similar to those based on traditional BBS regions and suggest minimal consequences of the reclassification for the BBS sample. We summarized population change within BCRs and assessed the efficiency of the BBS in estimating population change for 421 species surveyed. As would be expected from an omnibus survey, many species appeared to be poorly monitored by the BBS, with 42\% of species encountered at {\textless}1 bird per route from the survey, and 28\% of trend estimates too imprecise to detect a 3\% per year change over 35 years. Our results indicated that the quality of the survey for estimation of population change varied among BCRs. Population trends of species were heterogeneous over space and time, varying among BCRs for 76\% of species and over time for 39\% of species. Regional heterogeneity also existed in trends of species groups from the BBS. While 49\% of all species in the survey had increasing populations, grassland breeding birds showed consistent declines, with only 18\% of species having positive trend estimates. Bird Conservation Regions appear to provide reasonable strata for summary of BBS data.},

	abstract = {The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) contains data for .700 bird species, but analyses often focus on a core group of {\textasciitilde}420 species. We analyzed data for 122 species of North American birds for which data exist in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) database but are not routinely analyzed on the BBS Summary and Analysis Website. Many of these species occur in the northern part of the continent, on routes that fall outside the core survey area presently analyzed in the United States and southern Canada. Other species not historically analyzed occur in the core survey area with very limited data but have large portions of their ranges in Mexico and south. A third group of species not historically analyzed included species thought to be poorly surveyed by the BBS, such as rare, coastal, or nocturnal species. For 56 species found primarily in regions north of the core survey area, we expanded the scope of the analysis, using data from 1993 to 2014 during which !3 survey routes had been sampled in 6 northern strata (Bird Conservation regions in Alaska, Yukon, and Newfoundland and Labrador) and fitting log-linear hierarchical models for an augmented BBS survey area that included both the new northern strata and the core survey area. We also applied this model to 168 species historically analyzed in the BBS that had data from these additional northern strata. For both groups of species we calculated survey-wide trends for the both core and augmented survey areas from 1993 to 2014; for species that did not occur in the newly defined strata, we computed trends from 1966 to 2014. We evaluated trend estimates in terms of established credibility criteria for BBS results, screening for imprecise trends, small samples, and low relative abundance. Inclusion of data from the northern strata permitted estimation of trend for 56 species not historically analyzed, but only 4 of these were reasonably monitored and an additional 13 were questionably monitored; 39 of these species were likely poorly monitored because of small numbers of samples or very imprecisely estimated trends. Only 4 of 66 ‘‘new’’ species found in the core survey area were reasonably monitored by the BBS; 20 were questionably monitored; and 42 were likely poorly monitored by the BBS because of inefficiency in precision, abundance, or sample size. The hierarchical analyses we present provide a means for reasonable inclusion of the additional species and strata in a common analysis with data from the core area, a critical step in the evolution of the BBS as a continent-scale survey. We recommend that results be presented both 1) from 1993 to the present using the expanded survey area, and 2) from 1966 to the present for the core survey area. Although most of the ‘‘new’’ species we analyzed were poorly monitored by the BBS during 1993–2014, continued expansion of the BBS will improve the quality of information in future analyses for these species and for the many other species presently monitored by the BBS.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic noise can mask animal signals that are crucial for communicating information about food, predators and mating opportunities. In response to noise masking, signallers can potentially improve acoustic signal transmission by adjusting the timing, frequency or amplitude of their signals. These changes can be a short-term modification in response to transient noise or a long-term modification in response to chronic noise. An animal’s ability to adapt to anthropogenic noise can be crucial to its success. In this study, we evaluated the effects of anthropogenic noise on the structure of red-winged blackbird song. First, we manipulated the presence of anthropogenic noise by experimentally broadcasting either silence or low-frequency white noise to subjects inhabiting quiet marshes located away from roadsides. Subjects exhibited increased signal tonality when temporarily exposed to low-frequency white noise, suggesting that red-winged blackbirds can alter their signals rapidly in response to sudden noise. Second, we compared songs produced in quiet marshes located away from roadsides with songs produced during quiet periods at roadside marshes that are normally noisy. This allowed us to test whether birds that are exposed to chronic anthropogenic noise exhibit altered song structure during temporarily quiet periods. Subjects residing in roadside marshes that are normally polluted with anthropogenic noise sang songs with increased tonality during quiet periods. Overall, our results show that anthropogenic noise influences the structure of birdsong. These effects should be considered in conservation and wildlife management.},

I propose that this log-left-skew might be a sampling artefact. Monte Carlo simulations show that taking progressively larger samples from a log-unskewed distribution (such as the lognormal) causes log-skew to decrease asymptotically (move towards )1) until it reaches the level of the underlying distribution (zero in this case). In contrast, accumulating certain types of repeated small samples results in a log-skew that becomes progressively more log-left-skewed to a level well beyond the underlying distribution. These repeated samples correspond to samples from the same site over many years or from many sites in 1 year. Data from empirical datasets show that log-skew generally goes from positive (right-skewed) to negative (left-skewed) as the number of temporally or spatially replicated samples increases. This suggests caution when interpreting log-leftskew as a pattern that needs biological interpretation.},

Since the first assessments were made in the mid-1970s, both the dataset and the suite of statistical tools and techniques available to researchers have grown. As a result, Canadian BBS trend estimates have been derived from numerous statistical models. Because the BBS data are relatively complex, different statistical models can generate different trend and status estimates from the same data. In 2013, Environment Canada’s Canadian Wildlife Service began producing BBS status and trend estimates using a hierarchical Bayesian model. To give users of BBS trends and annual indices of abundance a better understanding of these estimates, we demonstrate and explain some of the similarities and differences between the new hierarchical Bayesian estimates and those from the previous model; discuss the philosophical and inferential consequences of estimating trends with the new model; and describe how the hierarchical Bayesian model differs from the model currently used in the United States. Overall, trends and annual indices from the new model are generally similar to estimates from the previous model; however, they are more precise, less variable among years, better represent the spatial variation across Canada in population status, and allow for more intuitive and useful assessments of uncertainty.},

SDMs are a widely-used tool that can provide probability of species occurrence in spatial explicit regions. With that in mind, SDMs can provide a prior probability of occurrence to feed into VOI, thus improving spatially-explicit management decisions over a large landscape. The authors provided two case studies: one case study considering a single species, and one case study considering multiple species (all plants). Eight variations of SDMs were created per species (varying in environmental predictors), and the best one was chosen for each species. Then, a binomial GLM was used to convert predicted habitat suitability into a probability of occurrence for each species per 1-ha unit, which was then used as priors in the VOI. The EV calculations for VOI followed Bennett et al. 2018. There are a number of future directions that were mentioned, including considering risk-tolerant vs. risk-averse, considering better detectability estimates, connectivity and/or dispersal potential (important probably for birds), delayed action, inclusion of benefits to improving SDM, monitoring decisions in space and time, and integration into an adaptive management framework.},

	abstract = {The influence of prior knowledge on memory is ubiquitous, making the specific mechanisms of this relationship difficult to disentangle. Here, we show that expert knowledge produces a fundamental shift in the way that interitem similarity (i.e., the perceived resemblance between items in a set) biases episodic recognition. Within a group of expert birdwatchers and matched controls, we characterized the psychological similarity space for a set of well-known local species and a set of less familiar, nonlocal species. In experts, interitem similarity was influenced most strongly by taxonomic features, whereas in controls, similarity judgments reflected bird color. In controls, perceived episodic oldness during a recognition memory task increased along with measures of global similarity between items, consistent with classic models of episodic recognition. Surprisingly, for experts, high global similarity did not drive oldness signals. Instead, for local birds memory tracked the availability of species-level name knowledge, whereas for nonlocal birds, it was mediated by the organization of generalized conceptual space. These findings demonstrate that episodic memory in experts can benefit from detailed subcategory knowledge, or, lacking that, from the overall relational structure of concepts. Expertise reshapes psychological similarity space, helping to resolve mnemonic separation challenges arising from high interitem overlap. Thus, even in the absence of knowledge about item-specific details or labels, the presence of generalized knowledge appears to support episodic recognition in domains of expertise by altering the typical relationship between psychological similarity and memory.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

At least three species have established breeding populations in the reserve over the past 10 years. Of 302 species reliably recorded to date, 182 (60.3\%) appear to be resident, 46 (15.2\%) are seasonal migrants and 74 (24.5\%) are vagrant visitors. Eight vulnerable and eight near-threatened bird species have been recorded; Blue Crane, Kori Bustard and African Crowned Eagle have bred in the reserve. Together with other state-owned and private protected areas in this region, this reserve holds a significant portion of the inland bird species recorded from the Eastern Cape.Conservation implications: The varied thicket vegetation types of the Great Fish River Valley support a considerable diversity of bird species. If these habitats are managed for biodiversity conservation, they can support a large component of the terrestrial avifauna of the Eastern Cape region.},

          Chaotic dynamics are thought to be rare in natural populations, but this may be due to methodological and data limitations, rather than the inherent stability of ecosystems. Following extensive simulation testing, we applied multiple chaos detection methods to a global database of 175 population time series and found evidence for chaos in {\textgreater}30\%. In contrast, fitting traditional one-dimensional models identified {\textless}10\% as chaotic. Chaos was most prevalent among plankton and insects and least among birds and mammals. Lyapunov exponents declined with generation time and scaled as the -1/6 power of mass among chaotic populations. These results demonstrate that chaos is not rare in natural populations, indicating that there may be intrinsic limits to ecological forecasting and cautioning against the use of steady-state approaches to conservation and management.},

However, a variety of potential biases in VGI are recognized, many of which root from volunteer data contribution activities. Examining patterns in volunteer data contribution activities helps understand the biases. Using eBird as a case study, this study investigates spatial and temporal patterns in data contribution activities of eBird contributors. eBird sampling eﬀorts are biased in space and time. Most sampling eﬀorts are concentrated in areas of denser populations and/or better accessibility, with the most intensively sampled areas being in proximity to big cities in developed regions of the world. Reported bird species are also spatially biased towards areas where more sampling eﬀorts occur. Temporally, eBird sampling eﬀorts and reported bird species are increasing over the years, with signiﬁcant monthly ﬂuctuations and notably more data reported on weekends. Such trends are driven by the expansion of eBird and characteristics of bird species and observers. The ﬁtness of use of VGI should be assessed in the context of applications by examining spatial, temporal and other biases. Action may need to be taken to account for the biases so that robust inferences can be made from VGI observations.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is an inherent part of knowledge, and yet in an era of contested expertise, many shy away from openly communicating their uncertainty about what they know, fearful of their audience's reaction. But what effect does communication of such epistemic uncertainty have? Empirical research is widely scattered across many disciplines. This interdisciplinary review structures and summarizes current practice and research across domains, combining a statistical and psychological perspective. This informs a framework for uncertainty communication in which we identify three objects of uncertainty—facts, numbers and science—and two levels of uncertainty: direct and indirect. An examination of current practices provides a scale of nine expressions of direct uncertainty. We discuss attempts to codify indirect uncertainty in terms of quality of the underlying evidence. We review the limited literature about the effects of communicating epistemic uncertainty on cognition, affect, trust and decision-making. While there is some evidence that communicating epistemic uncertainty does not necessarily affect audiences negatively, impact can vary between individuals and communication formats. Case studies in economic statistics and climate change illustrate our framework in action. We conclude with advice to guide both communicators and future researchers in this important but so far rather neglected field.},

However, the Act does not provide protection for species or their habitats on private lands, except for listed migratory birds or aquatic species. Voluntary stewardship is therefore necessary to conserve species at risk on private land, making the willingness of landowners to do this crucial for conservation. This paper presents a case study of rural private landowners in Prince Edward Island and explores relationships between voluntary stewardship activities of private landowners and knowledge and attitudes towards protection of species at risk. Data were collected using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, including semi-structured interviews of rural private landowners and a quantitative questionnaire for farmers. Most participants knew what was meant by the term “species at risk” but had little knowledge of the federal Act. Almost all agreed with the importance of protecting species at risk, particularly their habitat, and most said they would voluntarily change their land management practices to protect them. Many landowners expressed a need for more education and direction from government in managing their land to beneﬁt species at risk.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We present a method for estimating density of nesting birds based on double sampling. The approach involves surveying a large sample of plots using a rapid method such as uncorrected point counts, variable circular plot counts, or the recently suggested double-observer method. A subsample of those plots is also surveyed using intensive methods to determine actual density. The ratio of the mean count on those plots (using the rapid method) to the mean actual density (as determined by the intensive searches) is used to adjust results from the rapid method. The approach works well when results from the rapid method are highly correlated with actual density. We illustrate the method with three years of shorebird surveys from the tundra in northern Alaska. In the rapid method, surveyors covered ∼10 ha h–1 and surveyed each plot a single time. The intensive surveys involved three thorough searches, required ∼3 h ha–1, and took 20\% of the study effort. Surveyors using the rapid method detected an average of 79\% of birds present. That detection ratio was used to convert the index obtained in the rapid method into an essentially unbiased estimate of density. Trends estimated from several years of data would also be essentially unbiased. Other advantages of double sampling are that (1) the rapid method can be changed as new methods become available, (2) domains can be compared even if detection rates differ, (3) total population size can be estimated, and (4) valuable ancillary information (e.g. nest success) can be obtained on intensive plots with little additional effort. We suggest that double sampling be used to test the assumption that rapid methods, such as variable circular plot and double-observer methods, yield density estimates that are essentially unbiased. The feasibility of implementing double sampling in a range of habitats needs to be evaluated.},

                We are experiencing a global crisis in conservation, which has led to the prioritization of targets, such as nations, regions, and animal groups, which are necessary while resources are disputed. Brazil is a priority not only because of its megadiversity, high rates of endemism, and frequent descriptions of new species but also because of its high levels of deforestation. Among the species groups prioritized for conservation is the anurans (Amphibia: Anura), the population of which is severely declining. One group of anurans is the genus
                Brachycephalus
                , which includes 37 endemic species in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Some of these species have highly restricted distributions ({\textless}100 ha). Thirty new species have been described since 2000, and 55.3\% of all species are threatened with extinction.

                was only recently described and remains restricted to its type locality. Because of its reduced geographical distribution (0.41 km
                2
                ), it has been proposed to be considered as Vulnerable. The objective of this study is to reevaluate the conservation status of
                Brachycephalus tridactylus
                and propose conservation measures.
              
            
            
              Methods
              
                We searched for new populations during 2016–2020, evaluated
                in loco
                impacts and potential impacts on the species’ population, and performed an analysis of the density of this population and estimated its size. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria were used to assess the conservation status of the species.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We recorded the species in seven new localities (from 715–1,140 m above sea level) in the state of São Paulo up to 33 km from the type locality of the species (in state of Paraná). We estimated the area of occupancy as 148.44 km
                2
                , densities as one calling male per 4.05 m
                2
                and 130.00 m
                2
                , and a total population size of 4,429,722 adult individuals. Based on our finding, we proposed three lines of management: (1) formation of fire brigades, (2) management of residents’ mules in the conservation unit and surrounding areas, and (3) management of degraded areas. We recommend changing the species’ conservation status from Vulnerable to Endangered because of its fragmented distribution and decline in the area of occupancy and in the quality of its habitat. Our results have expanded the species previous geographic distribution and delimited areas without previous records. Our estimates of population density and size are in accordance with those verified for congeners. The conservation of this species benefits the environments and other species that inhabit them, being, therefore, strategic for receiving conservation actions that will spread throughout the ecosystem.},

              ). The numbers and biomass of phytoplankton gradually decrease downstream of the Ob River; below the confluence of the Irtysh River, the edge effect occurs: increase in the diversity and density of organisms at the boundaries of ecosystems. Compared to the previous studies, the proportion of green and euglena algae, and cyanoprokaryotes in the taxonomic spectrum of phytoplankton increased, the composition of the dominant complex enriched, including due to non-heterocyst forms of cyanoprokaryotes, and the trophic status of the river increased to the category of eutrophic waters.},

	abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

Now consider the scientific paper, the medium used to describe and publish these advances. How is the scientific paper advancing to meet the needs of those who generate and use scientific information? We review four essential qualities for the scientific paper of the future: (i) a robust source of trustworthy information that remains peer reviewed and is (ii) communicated to diverse users in diverse ways, (iii) open access, and (iv) has a measurable impact beyond Impact Factor. Since its inception, scientific literature has proliferated. We discuss the continuation and expansion of practices already in place including: freely accessible data and analytical code, living research and reviews, changes to peer review to improve representation of under-represented groups, plain language summaries, preprint servers, evidence-informed decision-making, and altmetrics.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the
              mgcv
              package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data. All code and data used to generate this paper are available at:

            We examined species limits, admixture, and genetic structure among populations in the Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli)–Gray-cheeked Thrush (C. minimus) species complex to establish the geographic and temporal context of speciation in this group, which is a model system in ecology and a high conservation priority. We obtained mitochondrial ND2 sequences from 186 Bicknell’s Thrushes, 77 Gray-cheeked Thrushes, and 55 individuals of their closest relative, the Veery (C. fuscescens), and genotyped a subset of individuals (n = 72) at 5,633 anonymous single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci. Between-species sequence divergence was an order of magnitude greater than divergence within each species, divergence was dated to the late Pleistocene (420 kbp) based on Bayesian coalescence estimation, and a coalescent model (IMa) revealed almost no gene flow between species based on ND2. SNP data were consistent with mitochondrial results and revealed low levels of admixture among species (3 of 37 Bicknell’s Thrushes, no Gray-cheeked Thrushes, and no Veeries were \&gt;2\% admixed). Species distribution models projected to the Last Glacial Maximum suggest that Bicknell’s Thrush and Gray-cheeked Thrush resided in primarily allopatric refugia in the late Pleistocene, consistent with the genetic data that support reproductive isolation over an extended period of time. Our genetic data suggest that both species underwent demographic expansions, possibly as they expanded out of Pleistocene refugia into their current ranges. We conclude that Bicknell’s Thrush and Gray-cheeked Thrush are 2 distinct species-level lineages despite low levels of Gray-cheeked Thrush introgression in Bicknell’s Thrushes, and divergence has been maintained by a long history of allopatry in subtly different habitats. Their unique phylogeography among boreal forest birds indicates that either cryptic species breaks in eastern North America are still undiscovered, or another factor, such as divergent natural selection, high migratory connectivity, or interspecific competition, played a role in their divergence.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the use of species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize patterns of species’ occurrence and abundance. Efforts to ­parameterize SDMs often create a tension between the quality and quantity of data available to fit models. Estimation methods that integrate both standardized and non-­standardized data types offer a potential solution to the tradeoff between data quality and quantity. Recently several authors have developed approaches for jointly modeling two sources of data (one of high quality and one of lesser quality). We extend their work by allowing for explicit spatial autocorrelation in occurrence and detection error using a Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive (MVCAR) model and develop three models that share information in a less direct manner resulting in more robust performance when the auxiliary data is of lesser quality. We describe these three new approaches (“Shared,” “Correlation,” “Covariates”) for combining data sources and show their use in a case study of the Brown-h­ eaded Nuthatch in the Southeastern U.S. and through simulations. All three of the approaches which used the second data source improved out-o­f-­sample predictions relative to a single data source (“Single”). When information in the second data source is of high quality, the Shared model performs the best, but the Correlation and Covariates model also perform well. When the information quality in the second data source is of lesser quality, the Correlation and Covariates model performed better suggesting they are robust alternatives when little is known about auxiliary data collected opportunistically or through citizen scientists. Methods that allow for both data types to be used will maximize the useful information available for estimating species distributions.},

	abstract = {The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) provides data that can be used in complex, multiscale analyses of population change, while controlling for scale-specific nuisance factors. Many alternative models can be fit to the data, but most model selection procedures are not appropriate for hierarchical models. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), in which relative model fit is assessed by omitting an observation and assessing the prediction of a model fit using the remainder of the data, provides a reasonable approach for assessing models, but is time consuming and not feasible to apply for all observations in large data sets. We report the first large-scale formal model selection for BBS data, applying LOOCV to stratified random samples of observations from BBS data. Our results are for 548 species of North American birds, comparing the fit of four alternative models that differ in year effect structures and in descriptions of extra-Poisson overdispersion. We use a hierarchical model among species to evaluate posterior probabilities that models are best for individual species. Models in which differences in year effects are conditionally independent (D models) were generally favored over models in which year effects are modeled by a slope parameter and a random year effect (S models), and models in which extra-Poisson overdispersion effects are independent and t-distributed (H models) tended to be favored over models where overdispersion was independent and normally distributed. Our conclusions lead us to recommend a change from the conventional S model to D and H models for the vast majority of species (544/548). Comparison of estimated population trends based on the favored model relative to the S model currently used for BBS summaries indicates no consistent differences in estimated trends. Of the 18 species that showed large differences in estimated trends between models, estimated trends from the default S model were more extreme, reflecting the influence of the slope parameter in that model for species that are undergoing large population changes. WAIC, a computationally simpler alternative to LOOCV, does not appear to be a reliable alternative to LOOCV.},

Unpaired males spent most of their time (Ͼ90\%) after dawn singing in Repeat mode, whereas paired males sang sporadically, in Serial as well as Repeat mode (51\% of their singing time). Males who lost their mates sang in Repeat mode at rates indistinguishable from males who had not yet obtained a mate.

Shifts by individuals in the timing of breeding with respect to variation in age and temperature are well documented in nature, and these changes are known to scale to affect population dynamics. However, relatively little is known about how organisms alter phenology in response to other demographic and environmental factors. We investigated how pre-breeding temperature, breeding population density, age, and rainfall in the first month of life influenced the timing and plasticity of lay date in a population of Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) monitored over 33 years (1987-2019). Females that experienced warmer pre-breeding temperatures tended to lay eggs earlier, and also advanced their lay date as they aged, but breeding population density had no effect on lay date. Natal precipitation interacted with age to influence lay date plasticity, with females that experienced high precipitation levels as nestlings advancing lay dates more strongly over the course of their lives. We also found evidence for varied pace of life; females that experienced high natal precipitation had shorter lifespans and reduced fecundity, but more nesting attempts over their lifetimes. Rainfall during the nestling period increased through time, while population density and fecundity declined, suggesting that increased precipitation on the breeding grounds may be detrimental to breeding females and ultimately the viability of the population as a whole. Our results suggest that females adjust their laying date in response to prebreeding temperature, and as they age, while presenting new evidence that environmental conditions during the natal period can affect phenological plasticity and generate downstream, population-level effects.},

However, the tasks, demands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in speech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which evidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In this paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for computational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and analyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the community should aim to address, in order to make the most of future developments in AI and informatics, and to use audio data in answering zoological and ecological questions.},

            Ecologists use a variety of systematically and opportunistically sampled count data to estimate bird abundance, and integrating or fusing different datasets has emerged as a critical challenge in recent years. While previous work provides data integration methodology for occupancy (presence/absence) estimation, methods for abundance estimation that account for imperfect detection and disparate survey protocols remains an active area of research. Here we show how to integrate systematically collected removal-in-time distance sampling data from the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program with North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) point counts and eBird community science observations. Using the Grasshopper Sparrow (
            Ammodramus savannarum
            ) in the Great Plains of the United States as a focal species, we demonstrate that BBS and eBird data improve predictive performance for IMBCR count data, providing more spatially refined and precise estimates of abundance at regional scales. Data fusion increased predictive performance even despite relatively weak spatial correlations among data sets. The methodology developed here provides a principled way to fuse data when estimating abundance with distance sampling, that accounts for imperfect detection and variable effort.},

Recently, novel simulation techniques, advances in computing power, and numerical methods for implementing statistical models have signiﬁcantly advanced our ability to integrate empirical and theoretical ecology. However, a divide still remains between mathematical and empirical studies, their readership, and integration into the broader literature. Because insights from mathematical ecology are far more general than the techniques employed, limitations in communicating mathematical advances to a broad spectrum of ecologists have arguably hindered ecology’s progress, particularly in confronting theoretical predictions with empirical experiments and data. Here, we present a guide for both authors and readers of mathematical ecology, with the aim of increasing the accessibility of mathematical ecology for a broad group of ecologists. We provide a list of best practices when both writing and reading mathematical ecology, incorporating examples from this Special Feature of Ecosphere.

Methods: We mapped vocal characters (28 acoustic and 10 syringeal) from total repertoires of all members of the tribe Aethiini onto a molecular phylogeny to compare the relative influence of phylogeny and breeding habitat on vocal divergence.
Conclusion: Phylogeny, visual display, and ecological factors have contributed to vocal divergence in this clade. Temporal attributes and syringeal attributes of the acoustics of vocalization showed high congruence with phylogeny. Frequency attributes, which are affected by environmental variables, showed low congruence, and therefore high homoplasy.},

	abstract = {The elaborate songs of songbirds are frequent models for investigating the evolution of animal signals. However, few previous studies have attempted to reconstruct historical changes in song evolution using a phylogenetic comparative approach. In particular, no comparative studies of bird song have used a large number of vocal characters and a well-supported, independently derived phylogeny. We identiﬁed 32 features in the complex vocal displays of male oropendolas (genera Psarocolius, Gymnostinops, and Ocyalus) that are relatively invariant within taxa and mapped these characters onto a robust molecular phylogeny of the group. Our analysis revealed that many aspects of oropendola song are surprisingly evolutionarily conservative and thus are potentially useful characters for reconstructing historical patterns. Of the characters that varied among taxa, nearly two thirds (19 of 29) showed no evidence of evolutionary convergence or reversal when mapped onto the tree, which was reﬂected in a high overall consistency index (CI ϭ 0.78) and retention index (RI ϭ 0.88). Some reconstructed patterns provided evidence of selection on these signals. For example, rapid divergence of the songs of the Montezuma oropendola, Gymnostinops montezuma, from those of closely related taxa suggests the recent inﬂuence of strong sexual selection. In general, our results provide insights into the mode of vocal evolution in songbirds and suggest that complex vocalizations can provide information about phylogeny. Based on this evidence, we use song characters to estimate the phylogenetic afﬁnities of three oropendola taxa for which molecular data are not yet available.},

          Identifying strategies that offer co-benefits for biodiversity protection, forest restoration and human well-being are important for successful conservation outcomes. In this study, we identified opportunities where forest restoration and rehabilitation programs in Colombia also align with priority areas for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds. We used citizen science eBird-based abundance estimates to define regions with the highest richness of Neotropical migratory birds of conservation concern at montane elevations in Colombia and aligned these high richness areas with domestic initiatives for forest protection (Forest Areas), restoration (Restoration Areas) and rehabilitation (Rehabilitation Areas). We quantified the location and amounts of these three areas as well as the type of land protection and designation within them, specifically, National Protected Areas, Indigenous Reserves, Afro-descendent territories, and regions affected by poverty and violence that are prioritized for rural development by the Colombian government in Post-conflict Territorially Focused Development Programs (PDET). Almost half of Forest Areas overlapped with PDETs where goals for economic development present a risk of forest loss if not done sustainably. There was a 20\% overlap between Forest Areas and Afro-descendant territories and indigenous reserves; most of this overlap was outside of established protected areas thus presenting an opportunity for community forest conservation that benefits migratory birds. We found an alignment of less than 6\% between migrant bird focal areas and the priority Restoration and Rehabilitation Planning Areas identified by the Colombian National Restoration Plan indicating less opportunity for these programs to simultaneously benefit Neotropical migrant species. Our approach highlights that timely and efficient conservation of declining migrants depends on identifying the regions and strategies that incorporate local communities as part of the solution to forest loss and degradation in Colombia.
          
            Highlights
            Colombia covers over half of key wintering areas for migratory birds in South America
            Most of the migrants’ overwinter range overlaps with working landscapes
            Priority national restoration/rehabilitation areas are ineffective to benefit migrants
            Forest conservation needs actions involving vulnerable and minority groups},

            Removal and distance modeling are two common methods to adjust counts for imperfect detection in point-count surveys. Several recent articles have formulated models to combine them into a distance-removal framework. We observe that these models fall into two groups building from different assumptions about the joint distribution of observed distances and first times to detection. One approach assumes the joint distribution results from a Poisson process (PP). The other assumes an independent joint (IJ) distribution with its joint density being the product of its marginal densities. We compose an IJ+PP model that more flexibly models the joint distribution and accommodates both existing approaches as special cases. The IJ+PP model matches the bias and coverage of the true model for data simulated from either PP or IJ models. In contrast, PP models underestimate abundance from IJ simulations, while IJ models overestimate abundance from PP simulations. We apply all three models to surveys of golden-crowned sparrows in Alaska. Only the IJ+PP model reasonably fits the joint distribution of observed distances and first times to detection. Model choice affects estimates of abundance and detection but has little impact on the magnitude of estimated covariate effects on availability and perceptibility.

Without personal connections to Indigenous communities, many Canadians fail to grasp the depth of intergenerational impacts of residential schools and associated systemic racism. Consequently, reconciliation remains an elusive concept. Here we outline 10 Calls to Action to natural scientists to enable reconciliation in their work. We focus on natural scientists because a common connection to the land should tie the social license of natural scientists more closely to Indigenous communities than currently exists. We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights. These 10 Calls to Action challenge the scientific community to recognize that reconciliation requires a new way of conducting natural science, one that includes and respects Indigenous communities, rights, and knowledge leading to better scientific and community outcomes.},

	abstract = {Past work ascribing priorities for the selection of nature reserves has weighted attributes and applied formulae in a single stage process. This single application of aformula means that areas of differing priority may contain similar mixes of species, communities or habitats, and may thus lead to imbalance in representation when preservation takes place, with some previously unpreserved or poorly preserved species, communities or habitats being found in several of the new reserves, and others being absent. An iterative method that has been applied to assess priorities for the preservation of threatened species in the central east coast of Tasmania overcomes this difficulty. The area with the highest score in the initial stages of analysis is assumed to be preserved and the weightings of attributes are altered accordingly. These new weightings are applied to locate the area of next highest priority, and the process continues until predetermined preservation goals are met.},

Merton identified the problem as one in which prominent researchers get disproportionately great credit for their contribution while relatively unknown researchers get disproportionately little credit (Merton, 1968). We measure the extent of this effect in the peer-review process through a pre-registered field experiment. We invite more than 3,300 researchers to review a paper jointly written by a prominent author -- a Nobel laureate -- and by a relatively unknown author -- an early-career research associate --, varying whether reviewers see the prominent author's name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less well-known author's name. We find strong evidence for the status bias: while only 23 percent recommend “reject” when the prominent researcher is the only author shown, 48 percent do so when the paper is anonymized, and 65 percent do so when the little-known author is the only author shown. Our findings complement and extend earlier results on double-anonymized vs. single-anonymized review (Peters and Ceci, 1982; Blank, 1991; Cox et al., 1993; Okike et al., 2016; Tomkins et al., 2017; Card and Della Vigna, 2020) and strongly suggest that double-anonymization is a minimum requirement for an unbiased review process.},

We deployed 68 eight-channel arrays at random locations in Labrador, Canada, during the 2016 avian breeding season. We returned in 2017 to the 18 array locations where the target species had been detected the previous year and characterized the microhabitat at the exact locations where they had been detected. We also characterized the microhabitat at randomly determined control locations. Results show that Boreal Chickadees select trees with greater diameter-at-breastheight that are surrounded by greater stem density. We did not ﬁnd evidence that Cape May Warblers exhibit microhabitat selection during song production. The study shows that microphone arrays are an effective tool for identifying preferred microhabitat that could be incorporated into future conservation or recovery strategies.},

	abstract = {Wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) are formed by a distributed group of acoustic-sensing devices featuring audio playing and recording capabilities. Current mobile computing platforms offer great possibilities for the design of audio-related applications involving acoustic-sensing nodes. In this context, acoustic source localization is one of the application domains that have attracted the most attention of the research community along the last decades. In general terms, the localization of acoustic sources can be achieved by studying energy and temporal and/or directional features from the incoming sound at different microphones and using a suitable model that relates those features with the spatial location of the source (or sources) of interest. This paper reviews common approaches for source localization in WASNs that are focused on different types of acoustic features, namely, the energy of the incoming signals, their time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), the direction of arrival (DOA), and the steered response power (SRP) resulting from combining multiple microphone signals. Additionally, we discuss methods not only aimed at localizing acoustic sources but also designed to locate the nodes themselves in the network. Finally, we discuss current challenges and frontiers in this field.},

	abstract = {Occupancy modelling is an increasingly common framework for analysing acoustic data to study the variation in populations through space and time, but different survey designs endow survey locations with varying degrees of biological meaning. Recording units may be preferentially deployed in areas known to be important to a species, which implies an ‘area of occupancy’ conception of a species range, or recording units may be randomly deployed without knowledge of focal species space-use (e.g. a survey grid), which implies an ‘extent of occurrence’ conception of a species range. Preferential sampling requires substantial pre-survey information (e.g. the location of focal species territories) but leads to intuitive parameter interpretation and greater precision; vastly greater survey coverage is attainable with random sampling, but the resulting data merit careful postprocessing to achieve precise, ecologically meaningful results. Importantly, occupancy, detection, extinction and colonization estimates are incomparable between study designs. However, an understanding of focal species movement and vocal behaviour can inform the development of creative deﬁnitions of acoustic detections – and thus site occupancy – which may help bring the ecological realism of preferential sampling to the data yielded by the more scalable random sampling approach. Understanding the implications of study design choices on parameter interpretation is a fundamental aspect of basic ecological inference and endangered species monitoring.},

The availability of such data has greatly expanded the scale of questions researchers can address. Yet, error, bias, and noise continue to be serious concerns for analysts, particularly when data being contributed to these giant online data sets are difﬁcult to verify. Counts of birds contributed to eBird, the world’s largest biodiversity online database, present a potentially useful resource for tracking trends over time and space in species’ abundances. We quantiﬁed counting accuracy in a sample of 1,406 eBird checklists by comparing numbers contributed by birders (N = 246) who visited a popular birding location in Oregon, USA, with numbers generated by a professional ornithologist engaged in a long-term study creating benchmark (reference) measurements of daily bird counts. We focused on waterbirds, which are easily visible at this site. We evaluated potential predictors of count differences, including characteristics of contributed checklists, of each species, and of time of day and year. Count differences were biased toward undercounts, with more than 75\% of counts being below the daily benchmark value. Median count discrepancies were −29.1\% (range: 0 to −42.8\%; N = 20 species). Model sets revealed an important inﬂuence of each species’ reference count, which varied seasonally as waterbird numbers ﬂuctuated, and of percent of species known to be present each day that were included on each checklist. That is, checklists indicating a more thorough survey of the species richness at the site also had, on average, smaller count differences. However, even on checklists with the most thorough species lists, counts were biased low and exceptionally variable in their accuracy. To improve utility of such bird count data, we suggest three strategies to pursue in the future. (1) Assess additional options for analytically determining how to select checklists that include less biased count data, as well as exploring options for correcting bias during the analysis stage. (2) Add options for users to provide additional information that helps analysts choose checklists, such as an option for users to tag checklists where they focused on obtaining accurate counts. (3) Explore opportunities to effectively calibrate citizen-science bird count data by establishing a formalized network of marquis sites where dedicated observers regularly contribute carefully collected benchmark data.},

	abstract = {Wetland loss is cause for concern for populations of many wetland bird species throughout North America. The North American Breeding Bird Survey, the primary resource for broad-scale avian population data, does not provide sufficient data for many marsh bird species. Targeted marsh bird monitoring programs have been implemented across the continent in an attempt to fill this gap. Despite these efforts, a number of wetland species are so elusive that they remain an analytical challenge because of small sample sizes and low detectability. Thus, there is need for tools and approaches that will increase sampling efficiency and boost geographic representation. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have the potential to address some of these challenges, but require the ability to combine in-person survey data with ARU data for collective analysis. Our primary objective was to estimate statistical offsets, or correction factors, to account for systematic differences between in-person and ARU counts of wetland-associated bird species. We found that ARU recordings were generally equivalent to in-person point counts, with bias in a small number of species (2 of 19 for Song MeterTM SM2 and 1 of 16 for Song MeterTM SM4 Acoustic Recorders; Wildlife Acoustics Inc. ©, Maynard, MA). However, bias was removed in all of the species through use of our correction factors. Therefore, our correction factors were effective for integrating in-person and ARU point count data even for species where differences exist. We also found that commercially available SM4 recorders have larger effective detection radii than SM2 recorders. Researchers should consider the microphone sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios of any recording unit before purchasing, and more sensitive models with lower noise should be used where possible. Our results, and particularly our correction factors, are useful for biologists combining in-person and ARU point count data to achieve larger sample sizes, higher statistical power, and ultimately better information for more effective wetland conservation.},

Although, the first one is starting to be fixed with ARU technology, and the second one is starting to be fixed using data harmonization techniques and things like NA-POPS.
I think one of the biggest things I agree with in this piece is the fact that expert knowledge and experience from surveys CANNOT be thrown out. I think using something like a Bayesian model for detectability where we can incorporate expert knowledge is big. Additonally, transparancy and open data, like I am trying to do with NA-POPS, can serve as a good way for the experts to vet estimates of detectability.

Systematic prioritization approaches typically determine locations for conservation that most effectively balance species protection with cost. Proxies for cost are frequently used in prioritizing land for protection. Here, we combine financial cost estimates for private land acquisition and species habitat models into a spatial prioritization to explore cost-effective habitat protection, using a case study of species at risk in Ontario, Canada. Our findings suggest a key trade-off, whereby protecting the areas with the greatest concentration of species at risk may not be the best strategy for protecting these species. Instead, protecting species at risk may be most cost effective in areas where species-at-risk richness is still relatively high, but land costs are relatively low, such as in central Ontario. However, the budget required to adequately protect species at risk through land purchase would be much larger than is currently available for conservation efforts, even if public lands are preferentially protected. Therefore, to effectively protect all species at risk in Ontario, we recommend the use of alternative conservation measures, such as easements and incentives for restoration on private land, to supplement already protected areas.},

	doi = {10.5751/ACE-02224-170213},
	abstract = {Long-distance migrant songbirds are declining globally. Reversing declines requires a good understanding of habitat quality. Local studies have shown that territory settlement date (arrival) is generally correlated with density and productivity. Despite widespread acceptance, large-scale multispecies demonstrations of arrival time being correlated with habitat quality are lacking. We investigated whether arrival date estimated from ecozonal scale bioacoustic monitoring could be predicted by an independent estimate of estimated density for Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Tennessee Warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina), and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata). We also examined local Ovenbird settlement patterns by comparing relative arrival and observed local density differences between nearby territories. Arrival date was estimated as the first focal species detection date on a breeding territory and the cure4insect R package was used to predict estimated average density. Using predicted average density as a habitat quality proxy, we found earlier arrivals in higher quality territories (Ovenbird 1.04 +/- 0.33 days earlier, Tennessee Warbler 1.96 +/- 0.36 days earlier, Yellow-rumped Warbler 1.23 +/- 0.54 days earlier). We also showed that arrival time was earlier in habitats preferred by each species. Spatial patterns of arrival varied among species although latitude was always an important predictor. Locations where predicted Ovenbird densities were estimated to be higher were filled before sites with lower predicted density but only 600 m away (2.9 +/- 1.4 days earlier). Correlating migrant arrival time and density suggests density is a reasonable measure of habitat quality. Combined, density and arrival data from bioacoustics provide a low-cost habitat-assessment tool that better informs the types of forest that need to be protected for species of concern, which will be particularly important as land-use and climate change impacts increase in the boreal forest.},

Valid com parison of these indices assumes that the detection process is comparable over space and time. These restrictive assumptions can be eliminated by estimating detection probabilities directly. We generalize a recently proposed removal model for estimat ing detection probabilities using a time-of-detection approach, which can account for more sources of variation in point-count data. This method is specifically designed to account for variation in detection probabilities associated with singing rates of birds. Our model accounts for both availability bias and detection bias by modeling the combined probability that a bird sings during the count, and the prob ability that it is detected given that it sings. The model requires dividing the count into several intervals and recording detections of individual birds in each interval.},

Freedman (Am Stat 37:152–155, 1983) demonstrated how common it is to select completely unrelated variables as highly “significant” when the number of data points is similar in magnitude to the number of variables. A new type of model averaging estimator based on model selection with Akaike’s AIC is used with linear regression to investigate the problems of likely inclusion of spurious effects and model selection bias, the bias introduced while using the data to select a single seemingly “best” model from a (often large) set of models employing many predictor variables. The new model averaging estimator helps reduce these problems and provides conﬁdence interval coverage at the nominal level while traditional stepwise selection has poor inferential properties.},

We present general methods for deriving new diffusion models and develop new software for fitting non-Gaussian evolutionary models to trait data. The theory of stochastic processes provides a mathematical framework for understanding the properties of current and future phylogenetic comparative methods.

We describe its use as a non-parametric Bayesian prior distribution, both for prediction (placing posterior distributions on ancestral functions) and model selection (comparing rates of evolution across a phylogeny, or identifying the most likely phylogenies consistent with the observed data). Our work is integrative, extending the popular phylogenetic Brownian motion and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models to functional data and Bayesian inference, and extending Gaussian process regression to phylogenies.

For s this gives the exact frequency distribution corresponding to the exact formula for s2 of Ornstein and Fürth. Discussion is given of the connection with the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation. By the same method exact expressions are obtained for the square of the deviation of a harmonically bound particle in Brownian motion as a function of the time and the initial deviation.

            The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is essential for practical and theoretical efforts to protect biodiversity. However, species classified as “Data Deficient” (DD) regularly mislead practitioners due to their uncertain extinction risk. Here we present machine learning-derived probabilities of being threatened by extinction for 7699 DD species, comprising 17\% of the entire IUCN spatial datasets. Our predictions suggest that DD species as a group may in fact be more threatened than data-sufficient species. We found that 85\% of DD amphibians are likely to be threatened by extinction, as well as more than half of DD species in many other taxonomic groups, such as mammals and reptiles. Consequently, our predictions indicate that, amongst others, the conservation relevance of biodiversity hotspots in South America may be boosted by up to 20\% if DD species were acknowledged. The predicted probabilities for DD species are highly variable across taxa and regions, implying current Red List-derived indices and priorities may be biased.},

Although various modeling techniques have recently been developed to account for this phenomenon, the biological basis of natural variation in detection remains insufficiently known. This study examined the bird species’ detection rate throughout the day, considering their body mass and diet type, concerning the environment and weather characteristics. Species detection rates were significantly affected by the number of individuals of that species but were unrelated to body mass. Overall, species with the highest detection rate were Corn bunting, Blackbird, European robin, House sparrow and Common chiffchaff. Granivores-insectivores and insectivores showed significant differences in detection rates throughout the day among habitats, with higher detection rates in grasslands during the afternoon. Insectivores showed higher detection rates in farmland during midday (warmest time of the day). Granivores, omnivores and scavengers did not show changes in detection rates in different day periods. Such patterns in daily detection rates were significant even when considering abundance and total species richness in each community. Finally, cloudiness was unrelated to the overall detection rate of birds, while temperature and wind affected detection rates in some guilds. Our findings provide some advice for choosing a suitable ornithological sampling method by considering the avian communities composition in combination with the type of environment, the diet of bird species, and the period of the day.},

Reported outcomes for participants and communities ranged from increasing personal knowledge and community awareness to changing attitudes and behaviors, building social capital, and ultimately, influencing change in natural resource management and policies. Mixed results were reported in regard to citizen participation in natural resource decision-making processes and in terms of participant knowledge gain. Future research recommendations that address identified knowledge gaps include the following: (1) assessing knowledge beyond the basic content of the subject of monitoring to better address the value of volunteer environmental monitoring as a public participation tool; (2) conducting independent research across programs to enable null or negative outcome reporting, understand commonalities of outcomes across programs, and make linkages between outcomes and program characteristics; (3) carrying out rigorous research that includes data collection and statistical analysis focused on the effectiveness of citizen participation in decision making; (4) assessing the time component of outcome achievement to inform the volunteer monitoring community; and (5) conducting additional research to identify changes in attitudes and behaviors, particularly geared toward minimizing losses in biodiversity and impacts of climate change.},

	abstract = {Many leading journals in ecology and evolution now mandate open data upon publication. Yet, there is very little oversight to ensure the completeness and reusability of archived datasets, and we currently have a poor understanding of the factors associated with high-quality data sharing. We assessed 362 open datasets linked to first- or senior-authored papers published by 100 principal investigators (PIs) in the fields of ecology and evolution over a period of 7 years to identify predictors of data completeness and reusability (data archiving quality). Datasets scored low on these metrics: 56.4\% were complete and 45.9\% were reusable. Data reusability, but not completeness, was slightly higher for more recently archived datasets and PIs with less seniority. Journal open data policy, PI gender and PI corresponding author status were unrelated to data archiving quality. However, PI identity explained a large proportion of the variance in data completeness (27.8\%) and reusability (22.0\%), indicating consistent inter-individual differences in data sharing practices by PIs across time and contexts. Several PIs consistently shared data of either high or low archiving quality, but most PIs were inconsistent in how well they shared. One explanation for the high intra-individual variation we observed is that PIs often conduct research through students and postdoctoral researchers, who may be responsible for the data collection, curation and archiving. Levels of data literacy vary among trainees and PIs may not regularly perform quality control over archived files. Our findings suggest that research data management training and culture within a PI's group are likely to be more important determinants of data archiving quality than other factors such as a journal's open data policy. Greater incentives and training for individual researchers at all career stages could improve data sharing practices and enhance data transparency and reusability.},

	abstract = {The Okavango Delta is renowned as an extraordinary ecosystem of high biodiversity, listed as both a Ramsar and World Heritage Site, with part protected in the Moremi Game Reserve. This extensive floodplain ecosystem has 444 recorded bird species, with just under a quarter of these waterbirds, including at least 16 breeding and 4 threatened (1 endangered, 3 vulnerable) species. Despite the global importance of this ecosystem, and its transboundary nature, there are sur­ prisingly few long-term assessments of status of the ecosystem or waterbird communities, a key indicator of ecosystem health, with threats such as upstream water extraction, and climate change threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We compiled a comprehensive 53-year dataset comprised of citizen science and other datasets (1970–2019), on 36 waterbird species (Anhin­ gidae, Ardeidae, Ciconiidae, Gruidae, Pelecanidae, Phalacrocoracidae, and Phoenicopteridae), including eight waterbird breeding colonies in the Okavango Delta. We investigated trends in waterbird biodiversity as well as responses to temperature, flow, flooding, and local rainfall. Waterbird breeding colonies were associated with relatively high areas of riparian woodland, and experienced moderate flooding frequencies ({\textgreater} 1 in 5 years). Total abundance of all 36 waterbird species was positively related to river flows. Despite increased citizen science effort over time, total abundance within the Okavango Delta significantly declined with declining average inun­ dation. Four species led these declines (African darter Anhinga rufa, green-backed heron Butorides striata, slaty egret Egretta vinaceigula, squacco heron Ardeola ralloides) and one marabou stork Leptoptilos crumenifer, increasing (only sufficient data to analyse 15 species individually). Decreased inundation within the Delta and other internal factors (urbanisation, tourism, vege­ tation change) as well as external factors (habitat loss elsewhere) are likely driving these declines. Rigorous monitoring of waterbirds, including the eight breeding colonies across the Delta, is needed to explore these changes closely, providing baselines in the case of water resource de­ velopments on the rivers supplying the Okavango Delta. Long-term conservation of the magnif­ icent Okavango Delta and its dependent biodiversity, including its waterbirds, is highly reliant on protection of river flows in three countries to ensure natural flooding regimes, alongside the conservation of neighbouring wetlands.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            To analyze species count data when detection is imperfect, ecologists need models to estimate relative abundance in the presence of unknown sources of heterogeneity. Two candidate models are generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and hierarchical N-mixture models. GLMMs are computationally robust but do not explicitly separate detection from abundance patterns. N-mixture models separately estimate detection and abundance via a latent state but are sensitive to violations in assumptions and subject to practical estimation issues. When one can assume that detection is not systematically confounded with ecological patterns of interest, these two models can be viewed as sharing a heuristic framework for relative abundance estimation. Model selection can then determine which predicts observed counts best, for example by AIC. We compared four N-mixture model variants and two GLMM variants for predicting bird counts in local subsets of a citizen science dataset, eBird, based on model selection and goodness-of-fit measures. We found that both GLMMs and N-mixture models—especially N-mixtures with beta-binomial detection submodels—were supported in a moderate number of datasets, suggesting that both tools are useful and that relative fit is context-dependent. We provide faster software implementations of N-mixture likelihood calculations and a reparameterization to interpret unstable estimates for N-mixture models.},

	abstract = {‘Ignorance is expensive’. The statement also applies to ignorance of research inefficiencies that can generate huge waste: 85\% of health research, amounting to \$170 billion annually, is avoidably wasted. This alarming finding elicited a number of responses that have since reduced the waste in health research. Commonality of research and dissemination practices implies that other scientific fields could also benefit from identifying and quantifying waste and acting to reduce it. Yet, no estimate of research waste is available for other fields. Given that ecological issues interweave most of the UN sustainable development goals, we argue tackling research waste in ecology should be prioritized.Our study leads the way. We estimate components of waste in ecological research, based on a systematic review and a meta-analysis. Shockingly, our results suggest only 11\%-18\% of conducted ecological research reaches its full informative value. Our duty towards science, environment, organisms we study, and the public dictates that we should urgently act and reduce this considerable yet preventable loss, and harness the full potential of ecological research. We propose to achieve this through actions from researchers, funders, journals, and academic institutions. Finally, we call for other research fields to adopt our framework and derive comparable estimates across scientific disciplines.},

	abstract = {Historical and long-term environmental datasets are imperative to understanding how natural systems respond to our changing world. Although immensely valuable, these data are at risk of being lost unless actively curated and archived in data repositories. The practice of data rescue, which we define as identifying, preserving, and sharing valuable data and associated metadata at risk of loss, is an important means of ensuring the long-term viability and accessibility of such datasets. Improvements in policies and best practices around data management will hopefully limit future need for data rescue; these changes, however, do not apply retroactively. While rescuing data is not new, the term lacks formal definition, is often conflated with other terms (i.e. data reuse), and lacks general recommendations. Here, we outline seven key guidelines for effective rescue of historically collected and unmanaged datasets. We discuss prioritization of datasets to rescue, forming effective data rescue teams, preparing the data and associated metadata, and archiving and sharing the rescued materials. In an era of rapid environmental change, the best policy solutions will require evidence from both contemporary and historical sources. It is, therefore, imperative that we identify and preserve valuable, at-risk environmental data before they are lost to science.},

To help EEB researchers adopt useful features from GitHub in their own workflows, we review twelve practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty: storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, and writing a manuscript. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.},

The Club originated in 1863 with the formation of the Ottawa Natural History Society which became the Natural History branch of the Ottawa Literary and Scientific Society in 1870, from which the OFNC formally separated in March 1879. Since that time, it has grown into Canada’s oldest and largest regional natural history organization and has produced a diverse and internationally recognized publication program. Since 1880 The Canadian Field-Naturalist and its predecessors have constituted the scientific core of the OFNC’s publication program, with Trail \& Landscape being an important Ottawa Valley publication since the late 1960s. The importance of both publications to the growth and health of the organization is reflected in the major surges in Club membership experienced when each of these publications was established. The focus of membership activities has changed over the history of the OFNC, with enlightened natural resource management, then original scientific research and local exploration directing energies in the early decades. By the early years of the 20th century the publications program become the raison d’etre of the Club, almost to the exclusion of local field activities. A renewed interest in field discovery and the growth of conservation awareness in the 1960s, however, rekindled local activities and re-established the balance which has sustained the organization throughout its history. Natural environment education has remained a critical theme within OFNC programs and activities. Over and above inspiring the professional careers and private interests of thousands of individuals for more than a century, the OFNC has had an important and lasting impact on the conservation of natural environment features and landscapes in Canada and North America.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Weather can have both delayed and immediate impacts on animal populations, and species have evolved behavioral adaptions to respond to weather conditions. Weather has long been hypothesized to affect the timing and intensity of avian migration, and radar studies have demonstrated strong correlations between weather and broad-scale migration patterns. How weather affects individual decisions about the initiation of migratory flights, particularly at the beginning of migration, remains uncertain.
            
            
              Methods
              Here, we combine automated radio telemetry data from four species of songbirds collected at five breeding and wintering sites in North America with hourly weather data from a global weather model. We use these data to determine how wind profit, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and cloud cover affect probability of departure from breeding and wintering sites.
            
            
              Results
              We found that the probability of departure was related to changes in atmospheric pressure, almost completely regardless of species, season, or location. Individuals were more likely to depart on nights when atmospheric pressure had been rising over the past 24 h, which is predictive of fair weather over the next several days. By contrast, wind profit, precipitation, and cloud cover were each only informative predictors of departure probability in a single species.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results suggest that individual birds actively use weather information to inform decision-making regarding the initiation of departure from the breeding and wintering grounds. We propose that birds likely choose which date to depart on migration in a hierarchical fashion with weather not influencing decision-making until after the departure window has already been narrowed down by other ultimate and proximate factors.},

              Background
              Each spring and fall billions of songbirds depart on nocturnal migrations across the globe. Theory suggests that songbirds should depart on migration shortly after sunset to maximize their potential for nightly flight duration or to time departure with the emergence of celestial cues needed for orientation and navigation. Although captive studies have found that songbirds depart during a narrow window of time after sunset, observational studies have found that wild birds depart later and more asynchronously relative to sunset than predicted.
            
            
              Methods
              We used coded radio tags and automated radio-telemetry to estimate the time that nearly 400 individuals from nine songbird species departed their breeding or wintering grounds across North America. We also assessed whether each species was most likely beginning long-distance migratory flights at departure or instead first making non-migratory regional flights. We then explored variation in nocturnal departure time by post-departure movement type, species, age, sex, and season.
            
            
              Results
              We found that 90\% of individuals from species that were likely initiating long-distance migratory flights departed within 69 min of civil dusk, regardless of species, season, age, or sex. By contrast, species that likely first made non-migratory regional movements away from the migratory destination departed later and more asynchronously throughout the night. Regardless of post-departure movement type, 98\% of individuals departed after civil dusk but otherwise showed no preference in relation to twilight phase.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although the presence of celestial orientation cues at civil dusk may set a starting point for departure each night, the fact that species likely beginning long-distance migration departed earlier and more synchronously relative to civil dusk than those first making non-migratory regional movements is consistent with the hypothesis that departing promptly after civil dusk functions to maximize the potential for nightly flight duration and distance. By studying the onset of migration, our study provides baseline information about departure decisions that may enhance our understanding of departure timing throughout migration.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          A shared goal within macroecology, biogeography and population ecology research is to understand biodiversity patterns and the processes driving them across spatial and taxonomic scales. A common approach to study macroecological patterns and processes involves developing and testing ecogeographical rules or hypotheses. The much-debated ‘abundant-centre’ hypothesis posits that species’ abundances are highest in their range centres and decline towards their range edges. We perform the largest global test of the hypothesis to date, on 3,675 species, using 6,055,549 abundance observations. Using meta-analytical approaches, we summarised species-level abundance–distance correlations exploring the effects of dispersal-related species traits on abundance–distance relationships. Overall, animals did not follow abundant-centre patterns, whereas plants tended to. Larger-bodied mammals were more likely to conform to abundant-centre patterns, as were mammals and freshwater fishes from higher latitudes. Perennial life cycles and large range sizes were significant predictors of abundant-centre patterns in plants. Trees and shrubs with larger seeds showed more support for abundant-centre patterns. Accounting for species dispersal improves models of abundant-centre patterns across geographic space. Assuming abundant-centre patterns represent optimal equilibria within nature, our findings suggest that abundant-centre relationships are not a general ecological phenomenon but tend to manifest only in species with higher dispersal capabilities.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Spatially explicit estimates of population density, together with appropriate estimates of uncertainty, are required in many management contexts. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach for estimating spatially varying density from distance sampling data. First, detection probabilities—perhaps depending on covariates—are estimated based on details of individual encounters; next, local densities are estimated using a GAM, by fitting local encounter rates to location and/or spatially varying covariates while allowing for the estimated detectabilities. One criticism of DSMs has been that uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the final variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage (regardless of its complexity) is captured as an extra random effect in the GAM stage. In effect, we refit an approximation to the detection function model at the same time as fitting the spatial model. This allows straightforward computation of the overall variance via exactly the same software already needed to fit the GAM. A further extension allows for spatial variation in group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability as well as directly affecting abundance. We illustrate these models using point transect survey data of Island Scrub-Jays on Santa Cruz Island, CA, and harbour porpoise from the SCANS-II line transect survey of European waters.

            Advances in technology are having a large effect on the priorities for innovation in statistical ecology. Collaborations between statisticians and ecologists have always been important in driving methodological development, but increasingly, expertise from computer scientists and engineers is also needed. We discuss changes that are occurring and that may occur in the future in surveys for estimating animal abundance. As technology advances, we expect classical distance sampling and capture-recapture to decrease in importance, as camera (still and video) survey, acoustic survey, spatial capture-recapture and genetic methods continue to develop and find new applications. We explore how these changes are impacting the work of the statistical ecologist.},

	abstract = {The causes of biodiversity change are of great scientific interest and central to policy efforts aimed at meeting biodiversity targets. Changes in species diversity and high rates of compositional turnover have been reported worldwide. In many cases, trends in biodiversity are detected, but these trends are rarely causally attributed to possible drivers. A formal framework and guidelines for the detection and attribution of biodiversity change is needed. We propose an inferential framework to guide detection and attribution analyses, which identifies five steps—causal modelling, observation, estimation, detection and attribution—for robust attribution. This workflow provides evidence of biodiversity change in relation to hypothesized impacts of multiple potential drivers and can eliminate putative drivers from contention. The framework encourages a formal and reproducible statement of confidence about the role of drivers after robust methods for trend detection and attribution have been deployed. Confidence in trend attribution requires that data and analyses used in all steps of the framework follow best practices reducing uncertainty at each step. We illustrate these steps with examples. This framework could strengthen the bridge between biodiversity science and policy and support effective actions to halt biodiversity loss and the impacts this has on ecosystems.

            Gaussian processes are powerful non-parametric probabilistic models for stochastic functions. However, the direct implementation entails a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance, and practical recommendations for how to select the number of basis functions and the boundary factor. Intuitive visualizations and recommendations, make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the boundary factor are adequate given the data. The approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

In addition to the lethal effect of predation, there can also be sublethal, negative effects of domestic cats on individual birds. These effects have led to the inference that reducing outdoor cat densities would benefit urban bird communities. Here we estimate the likely result of policies/programs designed to reduce densities of owned outdoor cats in urban areas, estimating relationships between bird richness/abundance and cat densities across 58 landscapes in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We estimate that we would most likely observe one additional bird species, and 0.003 additional individuals per species, if policies/programs reduced owned outdoor cat densities to zero in an average landscape in Ottawa (with 130.2 cats/km2). However, these effects of cat density on birds were uncertain, with 95\% confidence intervals crossing zero. Our findings—in combination with those of previous studies—suggest a need for research to resolve the apparent disconnect between the strong, negative effects of cats on individual urban birds and the weak, uncertain effects of cats on bird populations. Although measures that reduce owned outdoor cat densities are justified based on the precautionary principle, evidence to date does not support prioritizing these measures over those addressing threats that have consistently strong effects on bird populations.},

                  Assessing the biological relevance of variance components estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)‐based mixed‐effects models is not straightforward. Variance estimates are constrained to be greater than zero and their posterior distributions are often asymmetric. Different measures of central tendency for these distributions can therefore vary widely, and credible intervals cannot overlap zero, making it difficult to assess the size and statistical support for among‐group variance.

                  Die Beurteilung der biologischen Relevanz von Varianzkomponenten, die mit MCMC‐basierten gemischten Modellen geschätzt werden, ist nicht trivial. Varianzschätzungen sind notwendigerweise größer als Null, und ihre A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen sind oft asymmetrisch. Verschiedene Maße der zentralen Tendenz für diese Verteilungen können daher stark variieren, und die Kredibilitätsintervalle können nicht Null enthalten, was es schwierig macht, die Größe und die statistische Absicherung für die Varianz zwischen Gruppen zu bewerten. Die statistische Absicherung wird häufig durch eine visuelle Inspektion der gesamten A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung vorgenommen, so dass die Interpretation von subjektiven Entscheidungen abhängt.
                
                
                  Wir verwenden Simulationen, um die Schwierigkeiten bei der Beschreibung der A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen von Varianzschätzungen aus MCMC‐basierten Modellen zu demonstrieren. Anschließend beschreiben wir verschiedene Methoden zur Erzeugung einer erwarteten Nullverteilung (d.h. einer Verteilung der Effektgrößen, die sich ergeben würde, wenn es keine Varianz zwischen den Gruppen gäbe), die als Hilfe bei der Interpretation der Varianzschätzungen verwendet werden kann.
                
                
                  Durch den Vergleich häufig verwendeter Maße der zusammenfassenden Statistik von A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen der Varianzkomponenten zeigen wir, dass der A‐Posteriori‐Median in der Regel die geringste Verzerrung aufweist. Darüber hinaus zeigen wir, wie Nullverteilungen verwendet werden können, um einen p‐Wert abzuleiten, der zusätzliche Informationen zu den üblicherweise dargestellten Maßen der zentralen Tendenz und Unsicherheit liefert. Schließlich zeigen wir, wie diese p‐Werte die Durchführung von Trennschärfeanalysen innerhalb eines MCMC‐Ansatzes erleichtern.
                
                
                  Die Verwendung von Nullverteilungen für Varianzkomponenten kann das Studiendesign und die Interpretation der Ergebnisse von MCMC‐basierten Modellen unterstützen. Wir hoffen, dass dieses Manuskript Empiriker:innen, die gemischte Modelle verwenden, dazu anregt, sorgfältiger über ihre Ergebnisse, die deskriptiven Statistik‐Maße, die sie präsentieren, und die Schlussfolgerungen, die sie daraus ziehen können, nachzudenken.},

                    Predicting community‐level trait indices, such as community‐weighted mean or functional dispersion, in space or time, is crucial, as they are markers of ecosystem functions, proxies for ecosystem services, and are now integral part of conservation planning. On one hand, since members of a species share similar traits, a natural way is to model species distributions as a function of the environment first (i.e. with species distribution models), and then to reconstruct trait indices for any locality of interest (
                    predict‐first
                    ). On the other hand, community‐level trait indices can be seen as the direct result of environmental filtering, and thus their distributions may directly be modelled in response to the environment (
                    assemble‐first
                    ). Although relatively different, these two approaches have been used interchangeably in trait‐based ecology with unknown consequences on their usability.
                  
                
                
                  Here, using plant community (4463 plots) and trait data (LNC, leaf nitrogen content; PLH, plant height; SLA, specific leaf area, for {\textgreater}800 species) covering the French Alps, we compared the two approaches to predict community mean and functional dispersion indices, accounting or not for abundance (CM, community mean; CWM, community weighted mean; FDis, functional dispersion; uFDis, unweighted functional dispersion). We tested both interpolation versus extrapolation capabilities of the two approaches. To support the empirical findings, we also run the same comparative analysis on simulated community data.
                
                
                  
                    While both approaches produced similar and skillful CM/CWM predictions (
                    R
                    2
                     {\textgreater} 0.63 for CWM PLH) for interpolation, the assemble‐first outperformed the predict‐first approach for extrapolation to unobserved environmental conditions (
                    R
                    2
                     = 0.60 against 0.54 for CWM PLH). Functional dispersion was generally less well predicted, although the assemble‐first approach again provided better predictions for both interpolation (
                    R
                    2
                     = 0.31 against 0.27 for FDis PLH) and extrapolation (
                    R
                    2
                     = 0.28 against 0.18 for FDis PLH). The predict‐first approach systematically overestimated FDis. Results were confirmed by the simulation experiments.
                  
                
                
                  We conclude that the direct modelling of community‐level indices provides more robust spatial predictions over space and time and should thus be preferred. This approach also does not suffer from having generally too many species predicted by the predict‐first approach.},

	abstract = {When prioritizing regions for conservation protection, decisions are often based on the principle that a single large reserve should support more species than several small reserves of the same total area (SLOSS). This principle remains a central paradigm in conservation planning despite conflicting empirical evidence and methodological concerns. In urban areas where small parks tend to dominate and policies to promote biodiversity are becoming increasingly popular, determining the most appropriate prioritization method is critical. Here, we document the role of SLOSS in defining the seasonal diversity of birds in 475 parks in 21 US cities. Collections of small parks were consistently associated with higher species richness, spatial turnover and rarity. Collections of both small and large parks were associated with higher phylogenetic and functional diversity whose patterns varied across seasons and cities. Thus, collections of small parks are a reliable source of species richness driven by higher spatial turnover and rarity, whereas collections of both small and large parks contain the potential to support higher phylogenetic and functional diversity. The presence of strong intra-annual and geographical variation emphasizes the need for regional prioritization strategies, where multiple diversity metrics are examined across parks and seasons.},

                  Assessing the biological relevance of variance components estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)‐based mixed‐effects models is not straightforward. Variance estimates are constrained to be greater than zero and their posterior distributions are often asymmetric. Different measures of central tendency for these distributions can therefore vary widely, and credible intervals cannot overlap zero, making it difficult to assess the size and statistical support for among‐group variance. Statistical support is often assessed through visual inspection of the whole posterior distribution and so relies on subjective decisions for interpretation.

Enfin, nous montrons comment ces valeurs‐p facilitent la mise en œuvre d'analyses de puissance dans un cadre MCMC.
                
                
                  L'utilisation de distributions nulles pour les composantes de variance peut faciliter la conception des études et l'interprétation des résultats des modèles basés sur la méthode MCMC. Nous espérons que ce manuscrit permettra aux biologistes empiriques qui utilisent les modèles mixtes d'avoir une réflexion plus approfondie sur l'interprétation de leurs résultats, les statistiques descriptives qu'ils présentent et les inférences qu'ils font.

                  Die Beurteilung der biologischen Relevanz von Varianzkomponenten, die mit MCMC‐basierten gemischten Modellen geschätzt werden, ist nicht trivial. Varianzschätzungen sind notwendigerweise größer als Null, und ihre A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen sind oft asymmetrisch. Verschiedene Maße der zentralen Tendenz für diese Verteilungen können daher stark variieren, und die Kredibilitätsintervalle können nicht Null enthalten, was es schwierig macht, die Größe und die statistische Absicherung für die Varianz zwischen Gruppen zu bewerten. Die statistische Absicherung wird häufig durch eine visuelle Inspektion der gesamten A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung vorgenommen, so dass die Interpretation von subjektiven Entscheidungen abhängt.
                
                
                  Wir verwenden Simulationen, um die Schwierigkeiten bei der Beschreibung der A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen von Varianzschätzungen aus MCMC‐basierten Modellen zu demonstrieren. Anschließend beschreiben wir verschiedene Methoden zur Erzeugung einer erwarteten Nullverteilung (d.h. einer Verteilung der Effektgrößen, die sich ergeben würde, wenn es keine Varianz zwischen den Gruppen gäbe), die als Hilfe bei der Interpretation der Varianzschätzungen verwendet werden kann.
                
                
                  Durch den Vergleich häufig verwendeter Maße der zusammenfassenden Statistik von A‐Posteriori‐Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen der Varianzkomponenten zeigen wir, dass der A‐Posteriori‐Median in der Regel die geringste Verzerrung aufweist. Darüber hinaus zeigen wir, wie Nullverteilungen verwendet werden können, um einen p‐Wert abzuleiten, der zusätzliche Informationen zu den üblicherweise dargestellten Maßen der zentralen Tendenz und Unsicherheit liefert. Schließlich zeigen wir, wie diese p‐Werte die Durchführung von Trennschärfeanalysen innerhalb eines MCMC‐Ansatzes erleichtern.
                
                
                  Die Verwendung von Nullverteilungen für Varianzkomponenten kann das Studiendesign und die Interpretation der Ergebnisse von MCMC‐basierten Modellen unterstützen. Wir hoffen, dass dieses Manuskript Empiriker:innen, die gemischte Modelle verwenden, dazu anregt, sorgfältiger über ihre Ergebnisse, die deskriptiven Statistik‐Maße, die sie präsentieren, und die Schlussfolgerungen, die sie daraus ziehen können, nachzudenken.},

	abstract = {Although variation in effect sizes and predicted values among studies of similar phenomena is inevitable, such variation far exceeds what might be produced by sampling error alone. One possible explanation for variation among results is differences among researchers in the decisions they make regarding statistical analyses. A growing array of studies has explored this analytical variability in different (mostly social science) fields, and has found substantial variability among results, despite analysts having the same data and research question. We implemented an analogous study in ecology and evolutionary biology, fields in which there have been no empirical exploration of the variation in effect sizes or model predictions generated by the analytical decisions of different researchers. We used two unpublished datasets, one from evolutionary ecology (blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, to compare sibling number and nestling growth) and one from conservation ecology (Eucalyptus, to compare grass cover and tree seedling recruitment), and the project leaders recruited 174 analyst teams, comprising 246 analysts, to investigate the answers to prespecified research questions. Analyses conducted by these teams yielded 141 usable effects for the blue tit dataset, and 85 usable effects for the Eucalyptus dataset. We found substantial heterogeneity among results for both datasets, although the patterns of variation differed between them. For the blue tit analyses, the average effect was convincingly negative, with less growth for nestlings living with more siblings, but there was near continuous variation in effect size from large negative effects to effects near zero, and even effects crossing the traditional threshold of statistical significance in the opposite direction. In contrast, the average relationship between grass cover and Eucalyptus seedling number was only slightly negative and not convincingly different from zero, and most effects ranged from weakly negative to weakly positive, with about a third of effects crossing the traditional threshold of significance in one direction or the other. However, there were also several striking outliers in the Eucalyptus dataset, with effects far from zero. For both datasets, we found substantial variation in the variable selection and random effects structures among analyses, as well as in the ratings of the analytical methods by peer reviewers, but we found no strong relationship between any of these and deviation from the meta-analytic mean. In other words, analyses with results that were far from the mean were no more or less likely to have dissimilar variable sets, use random effects in their models, or receive poor peer reviews than those analyses that found results that were close to the mean. The existence of substantial variability among analysis outcomes raises important questions about how ecologists and evolutionary biologists should interpret published results, and how they should conduct analyses in the future.},

	abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross‐validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross‐validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non‐causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross‐validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non‐random and blocked cross‐validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross‐validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross‐validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross‐validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

              Negative bias in mark‐recapture abundance estimators due to heterogeneity in detection (capture) probability is a well‐known problem, but we believe most biologists do not understand why heterogeneity causes bias and how bias can be reduced. We demonstrate how heterogeneity creates dependence and bias in mark‐recapture approaches to abundance estimation. In comparison, heterogeneity, and hence estimator bias, is not as problematic for distance sampling and mark‐resight methods because both techniques estimate detection probabilities based on a known quantity. We show how the introduction of a known number of individuals planted into a study population prior to a mark‐recapture survey can reduce bias from heterogeneity in detection probability. We provide examples with simulation and an analysis of motion‐sensitive camera data from a study population of introduced eastern wild turkeys (
              Meleagris gallopavo silvestris
              ) of known size with a subset of telemetered birds. In choosing a method for abundance estimation, careful consideration should be given to assumptions and how heterogeneity in detection probability can be accommodated for each application.},

                    Species distribution modelling (
                    SDM
                    ) is widely used in ecology, and predictions of species distributions inform both policy and ecological debates. Therefore, methods with high predictive accuracy and those that enable biological interpretation are preferable. Gaussian processes (
                    GP
                    s) are a highly flexible approach to statistical modelling and have recently been proposed for
                    SDM
                    .
                    GP
                    models fit smooth, but potentially complex response functions that can account for high‐dimensional interactions between predictors. We propose fitting
                    GP SDM
                    s using deterministic numerical approximations, rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to make
                    GP

                    We introduce
                    GP
                    models and their application to
                    SDM

                    GP SDM

                    GP SDM
                    that can be fitted efficiently. This model can be fitted either by learning the hyperparameters or by using a fixed approximation to them. Using a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey data set, we compare the out‐of‐sample predictive accuracy of these models with several commonly used
                    SDM
                    approaches for both presence/absence and presence‐only data.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Predictive accuracy of
                    GP SDM
                    s fitted by Laplace approximation was greater than boosted regression trees, generalized additive models (
                    GAM
                    s) and logistic regression when trained on presence/absence data and greater than all of these models plus MaxEnt when trained on presence‐only data.
                    GP SDM
                    s fitted using a fixed approximation to hyperparameters were no less accurate than those with MAP estimation and on average 70 times faster, equivalent in speed to GAMs.
                  
                
                
                  
                    As well as having strong predictive power for this data set,
                    GP SDM

              ), managers of the recovery effort stressed creating new jack pine stands and monitoring numbers of singing males through an annual census using single visits to individual stands. Kirtland's warbler will occupy and breed in red pine (
              P. resinosa
              ), but red pine has not been surveyed for Kirtland's warblers in the annual population census. Furthermore, the current monitoring approach cannot determine their species detection probability or individual detection probability, which is essential to evaluate both red pine use and the accuracy of the census. From 2016–2018 we estimated density and detection probabilities in jack pine and red pine stands through repeated visits to a limited number of stands rather than single visits to many stands. Estimates of species detection probability indicated that ≥1 male Kirtland's warbler would be detected on most sites when any were present, but individual detection probabilities were less and varied by stand type, indicating that single visits to sites would underestimate numbers and that accurate estimation of detection probability was important for estimation of density in different stand types. We offer quantitative estimates of detection probabilities for determination of Kirtland's warbler population size in jack pine versus red pine stands in the same areas and breeding seasons. Managers of Kirtland's warblers should incorporate detection probabilities into population surveys to achieve more accurate estimates of population size.},

We will look at the many different factors involved in the naming of birds in the Anishinaabe language. Different than scientific taxonomy in the opportunity for the names to not only be focused on positive identification using physical features (Red Tailed Hawk, bobolink, Catbird) but also utilizing other unique behaviors like:
- Nesting behaviors (Winter Wren)
- Food Acquisition behaviors (Shoveller, Northern Flicker)
- Flight behaviors (Rough Legged Hawk, Kingfisher, Grackle)

- Epitomize their environment (Bittern)
- Environmental functions/responsibilities (Vulture, Rails)
- Mourning rituals (Loon, Cuckoo, Red-Eyed Vireo)
- Weather (White Throated sparrow)
- Hunting (Common Raven)
Throughout this presentation Joe will also be speaking to the vastness of knowledge generated by Indigenous bird observation.

              Aim
              
                Recent studies have found that local‐scale plots measured through time exhibit marked variation in the change in species richness. However, the overall effect often reveals no net change. Most studies to date have been agnostic about the identities of the species lost/gained and about the processes that might lead to these changes. Generalist traits might be crucial in allowing species to colonize new plots or remain resilient
                in situ
                , whereas environmental filtering might remove specialists. We test whether plots are changing in species richness, whether they are becoming more similar (i.e., becoming homogenized) through time and whether several generalist traits can predict gains or losses from local plots.
              
            
            
              Location
              Canada.
            
            
              Time period
              1945–2015.
            
            
              Major taxa studied
              Two hundred and sixty‐five species of butterflies.
            
            
              Methods
              We measured change in species richness and pairwise beta diversity across 96 well‐sampled 10 km × 10 km plots across Canada between two time periods: 1945–1975 and 1985–2015. We looked at the effects of wing span, mobility, dietary breadth and range size on the number of grid cells each species gained and lost between time periods.
            
            
              Results
              We observed a slight increase in plot‐level species richness, and that these communities are becoming homogenized through time. We note that most butterfly species in Canada have large North American ranges. The species with the widest ranges are better able to colonize new plots than species with narrower ranges, but also experience higher frequencies of local extinctions. In sum, the median range size of species within a plot increased through time.
            
            
              Main conclusions
              We highlight that, even when local species richness exhibits very little change, other potentially important changes in biodiversity can occur, such as geographical homogenization attributable to the colonization dynamics of species that are already widely distributed. Such patterns can reconcile observed global losses of species with the simultaneous lack of change in local diversity.},

	url = {https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/6172/},
	abstract = {Spatial patterns in population trends, particularly those at finer geographic scales, can help us better understand the factors driving population change in North American birds. The standard status and trend models for the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) were designed to estimate trends within broad geographic strata, such as Bird Conservation Regions, U.S. states, and Canadian territories or provinces. Calculating trend estimates at the level of individual survey transects (“routes”) from the BBS allows us to explore finer spatial patterns and simultaneously estimate the effects of covariates, such as habitat-loss or annual weather, on both relative abundance and trend (changes in relative abundance through time). Here, we describe four related hierarchical Bayesian models that estimate trends for individual BBS routes, implemented in the probabilistic programing language Stan. All four models estimate route-level trends and relative abundances using a hierarchical structure that shares information among routes, and three of the models share information in a spatially explicit way. The spatial models use either an intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive structure or a distance-based Gaussian process to estimate the spatial components. We fit all four models to data for 71 species and then fit only two of the models (one spatial and one non-spatial) for an additional 216 species due to computational limitations. Leave-future-out cross-validation showed the spatial models outperformed the non-spatial model for 284 out of 287 species. For the species tested here, the best approach to modeling the spatial components depended on the species; the Gaussian Process had the highest predictive accuracy for 2/3 of the species tested here and the iCAR was better for the remaining 1/3.  We also present two examples of route-level covariate analyses focused on spatial and temporal variation in habitat for Rufous Hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) and Horned Grebe (Podiceps auritus). Covariates explain or affect patterns in the rate of population change for both species. Route-level models for BBS data are useful for visualizing spatial patterns of population change, generating hypotheses on the causes of change, comparing patterns of change among regions and species, and testing hypotheses on causes of change with relevant covariates.},

I performed a literature review to evaluate the current applications and performance of BirdNET, which is growing in popularity but has been subject to few assessments, and to provide recommendations for future studies using BirdNET. Prior research has employed BirdNET for a wide range of purposes but few studies have linked BirdNET detections to ecological processes or real‐world monitoring schemes. Among evaluated studies, average precision (\% detections correctly identified) usually ranged around 72–85\%, and recall rate (\% target species vocalizations detected) ranged around 33–84\%. Some studies did not assess BirdNET performance, which hampers the interpretation of the ecological results and may provide poorly informed decisions. Recommendations on how to evaluate BirdNET efficiency are provided. The impact of the confidence score threshold, a user‐selected parameter as the minimum score for detections reported, on BirdNET output although variable among species is consistent. The use of high confidence score thresholds increases the percentage of detections correctly classified but lowers the proportion of calls and bird species detected. The selection of an optimal score may depend on the priorities of the user and research goals. BirdNET is a great tool for automated bird monitoring but it should be used with caution due to inherent challenges for automated bird identification. The continued refinement of BirdNET suggests further improvements in the coming years.},

We compile the present-day global body size-biomass spectra for the terrestrial, marine, and subterranean realms. To achieve this compilation, we pair existing and updated biomass estimates with previously uncatalogued body size ranges across all free-living biological groups. These data show that many biological groups share similar ranges of body sizes, and no single group dominates size ranges where cumulative biomass is highest. We then propagate biomass and size uncertainties and provide statistical descriptions of body size-biomass spectra across and within major habitat realms. Power laws show exponentially decreasing abundance (exponent -0.9±0.02 S.D.,

The results suggest that the global body size-biomass relationships is bimodal, but substantial one-to-two orders-of-magnitude uncertainty mean that additional data will be needed to clarify whether global-scale universal constraints or local forces shape these patterns.},

	abstract = {Classifying species into risk categories is a ubiquitous process in conservation decision-making affecting regu­ latory procedures, conservation actions, and guiding resource allocation at global, national, and regional scales. However, monitoring programs often do not provide data required for accurate species classification decisions. Misclassification can lead to otherwise preventable species extinctions, undue regulatory burden, poor allocation of limited conservation resources, and can undermine species conservation legislation. We developed a frame­ work that evaluates monitoring designs based on the ability to correctly inform a species classification decision, where minimizing the risk of misclassification is the central objective. We further evaluated monitoring designs by calculating the expected value of information and explored the relationship between statistical power to detect trends and misclassification. Our measure of misclassification risk, which can be tailored to the decision context, clarified the costs of over- and under-protection. High power to detect trends often corresponded to accurate species classification decisions. However, in several scenarios power to detect trends was low but the ability to correctly inform the classification decision was high. The value of information generally increased with monitoring intensity and quantified the tradeoffs between spatial and temporal replication. Our framework al­ lows managers to assess monitoring program performance with direct implications for conservation decisionmaking. Our framework affords practitioners an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring pro­ grams a priori focusing on improving conservation decisions. We demonstrate that prioritizing monitoring to minimize misclassification errors can improve monitoring efficiency and conservation decision-making with considerable practical applications and benefits for species conservation.},

                  Population size is a key metric for management and policy decisions, yet wildlife monitoring programmes are often limited by the spatial and temporal scope of surveys. In these cases, citizen science data may provide complementary information at higher resolution and greater extent.
                
                
                  We present a case study demonstrating how data from the eBird citizen science programme can be combined with regional monitoring efforts by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to produce high‐resolution estimates of golden eagle abundance. We developed a model that uses aerial survey data from the western United States to calibrate high‐resolution annual estimates of relative abundance from eBird. Using this model, we compared regional population size estimates based on the calibrated eBird information with those based on aerial survey data alone.
                
                
                  Population size estimates based on the calibrated eBird information had strong correspondence to estimates from aerial survey data in two out of four regions, and population trajectories based on the two approaches showed high correlations.
                
                
                  We demonstrate how the combination of citizen science data and targeted surveys can be used to (a) increase the spatial resolution of population size estimates, (b) extend the spatial extent of inference and (c) predict population size beyond the temporal period of surveys. Findings based on this case study can be used to refine policy metrics used by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and inform permitting regulations (e.g. mortality/harm associated with wind energy development).

After validating citizen science data against survey‐based benchmarks, agencies can harness strengths of citizen science data to supplement information needs and increase the resolution and extent of population size predictions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Among other approaches, camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) is used to estimate animal abundance from unmarked populations. It was formulated for videos and observation distances are measured at predetermined ‘snapshot moments’. Surveys recording still images with passive infrared motion sensors suffer from frequent periods where animals are not photographed, either because of technical delays before the camera can be triggered again (i.e. ‘camera recovery time’) or because they remain stationary and do not immediately retrigger the camera following camera recovery time (i.e. ‘retrigger delays’). These effects need to be considered when calculating temporal survey effort to avoid downwardly biased abundance estimates. Here, we extend the CTDS model for passive infrared motion sensor recording of single images or short photo series. We propose estimating ‘mean time intervals between triggers’ as combined mean camera recovery time and mean retrigger delays from the time interval distribution of pairs of consecutive pictures, using a Gamma and Exponential function, respectively. We apply the approach to survey data on red deer, roe deer and wild boar. Mean time intervals between triggers were very similar when estimated empirically and when derived from the model‐based approach. Depending on truncation times (i.e. the time interval between consecutive pictures beyond which data are discarded) and species, we estimated mean time intervals between retriggers between 8.28 and 15.05 s. Using a predefined snapshot interval, not accounting for these intervals, would lead to underestimated density by up to 96\% due to overestimated temporal survey effort. The proposed approach is applicable to any taxa surveyed with camera traps. As programming of cameras to record still images is often preferred over video recording due to reduced consumption of energy and memory, we expect this approach to find broad application, also for other camera trap methods than CTDS.},

	abstract = {A major barrier to advancing ornithology is the systemic exclusion of professionals from the Global South. A recent special feature, Advances in Neotropical Ornithology, and a shortfalls analysis therein, unintentionally followed a long-standing pattern of highlighting individuals, knowledge, and views from the Global North, while largely omitting the perspectives of people based within the Neotropics. Here, we review current strengths and opportunities in the practice of Neotropical ornithology. Further, we discuss problems with assessing the state of Neotropical ornithology through a northern lens, including discovery narratives, incomplete (and biased) understanding of history and advances, and the promotion of agendas that, while currently popular in the north, may not fit the needs and realities of Neotropical research. We argue that future advances in Neotropical ornithology will critically depend on identifying and addressing the systemic barriers that hold back ornithologists who live and work in the Neotropics: unreliable and limited funding, exclusion from international research leadership, restricted dissemination of knowledge (e.g., through language hegemony and citation bias), and logistical barriers. Moving forward, we must examine and acknowledge the colonial roots of our discipline, and explicitly promote anti-colonial agendas for research, training, and conservation. We invite our colleagues within and beyond the Neotropics to join us in creating new models of governance that establish research priorities with vigorous participation of ornithologists and communities within the Neotropical region. To include a diversity of perspectives, we must systemically address discrimination and bias rooted in the socioeconomic class system, anti-Blackness, anti-Brownness, anti-Indigeneity, misogyny, homophobia, tokenism, and ableism. Instead of seeking individual excellence and rewarding top-down leadership, institutions in the North and South can promote collective leadership. In adopting these approaches, we, ornithologists, will join a community of researchers across academia building new paradigms that can reconcile our relationships and transform science.

                  Passive acoustic monitoring of biodiversity is growing fast, as it offers an alternative to traditional aural point count surveys, with the possibility to deploy long‐term acoustic surveys in large and complex natural environments. However, there is still a clear need to evaluate how the frequency‐ and distance‐dependent attenuation of sound as well as the ambient sound level impact the acoustic detection distance of the soniferous species in natural environments over the diel cycles and across seasons. This is of great importance to avoid pseudoreplication and to provide relevant biodiversity indicators, including species richness, species abundance and species density.
                
                
                  To address the issue of detection distance, we tested a field‐based protocol in a Neotropical rainforest (French Guiana, France) and in an Alpine coniferous forest (Jura, France). This standardized and repeatable method consists in a recording session of the ambient sound directly followed by an experiment using a calibrated white noise sound broadcast at different positions along a 100 m linear transect. We then used acoustic laws to reveal the basic physics behind sound propagation attenuation.
                
                
                  We demonstrate that habitat attenuation in two different kinds of forests can be modelled by an exponential decay law with a linear dependence on frequency and distance. We also report that habitat attenuation, as first approximation, can be summarized by a single value, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat.
                
                
                  Finally, we show that the detection distance can be predicted knowing the contribution of each attenuation factor, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat, the ambient sound pressure level and the amplitude and frequency bandwidth characteristics of the transmitted sound. We show that the detection distance mostly depends on the ambient sound and may vary by a factor of up to 5 over the diel cycle and across seasons. These results reinforce the need to take into account the variation of the detection distance when performing passive acoustic surveys and producing reliable biodiversity indicators.},

            Passive acoustic monitoring has proven to have many advantages for monitoring efforts and research activities. However, there are considerations to be taken into account regarding the placement of autonomous sound recorders. Detection ranges differ among species and in response to variable conditions such as weather or the location of vocalising animals. It is thus important to the success of a research project to understand, with a certain degree of confidence, the distances at which birds might be detected. In two types of forests in Poland, we played back the vocalisations of 31 species of European forest birds exemplifying different singing characteristics. Based on recordings obtained along a 500-m transect, we estimated the probability of detection and maximum detection distance of each vocalisation. We broadcasted the recording at three heights of singing and repeated playbacks three times during the breeding season to evaluate the effect of vegetation growth. Our results revealed that environmental and meteorological factors had a significant influence on both detection probability and maximum detection distances. This work provides comprehensive measurements of detection distance for 31 bird species and can be used to plan passive acoustic monitoring research in Europe, taking into account species traits and individual characteristics of the study area.},

                  Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming.
                
                
                  We offer a 10‐step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature.
                
                
                  Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

	abstract = {Examination of population trends for raptors is a research priority, especially given recent concern for their conservation status. Road counts—in which raptors are counted from a motorized vehicle moving along the ground—might be an effective method to expand the monitoring of raptor populations and estimation of trends. Here, we review past methods used to perform road counts of raptors and present revised recommendations to aid collaboration, data transfer, and interpretation of results across monitoring programs. We performed a standardized keyword search of online literature databases to obtain 148 past road count studies. The number of studies employing road counts increased per year since the 1970s. Most of these studies occurred in North America. The times of day during which road counts were conducted ranged from sunrise to sunset, and maximum speeds ranged from 10 to 113 km hr–1. The number of observers ranged from 1 (the driver) to 5. Most (93) of the studies used unlimited-width transects and fixed-width transects ranging from 0.02 to 2.50 km wide. Sixteen percent of studies calculated or corrected for the probability of detection. Such broad variation in the methodology used during road counts, coupled with infrequent correction for detection, hampers the interpretation of results across road survey programs. We suggest that road count practitioners should emphasize the collection of data, such as speed, number of observers, and distance to observed raptors, which would allow for the calculation of detection-corrected estimates. Such correction would likely improve trend estimation. Recent technology, including mobile apps, allows researchers to collect such data relatively easily, conducting their own studies while contributing to a broader raptor monitoring initiative. Road counts will likely become more useful as statistical analysis of road count data improves and researchers pool their data in a global effort to monitor raptors.},

Here, we discuss the growing demand for understanding these non-fueling behaviors and for restoring the inherent behavioral complexity to stopover events. We begin by describing how light-weight tracking technologies allow researchers to follow individuals along their entire migratory journeys, capturing stopovers that controvert the traditional stop–refuel–resume paradigm. We then discuss 5 well-identified non-fueling behaviors—recovering, sleeping, waiting, information gathering, and social interactions—and examine how including these behaviors can alter interpretations of individual movement paths. Finally, we outline emerging directions for identifying these behaviors and look to larger implications for population management and site conservation along migratory flyways.},

              Accurate estimates of population abundance are essential to both theoretical and applied ecology. Rarely are all individuals detected during a survey and abundance models often incorporate some form of imperfect detection. Detection probability, however, consists of three components: probability of presence during a survey, probability of availability given presence, and probability of detection given availability and presence. We develop an integrated model to separate these three detection components and provide abundance estimates for the available, present, and superpopulation of individuals. Our framework integrates several common survey methods for unmarked populations: spatially and temporally replicated counts, distance sampling data, and time‐of‐detection data. Simulations indicated relatively unbiased estimates for detection and availability probabilities. Negative bias in estimated superpopulation abundance was present with three temporally replicated surveys, but greatly reduced with six surveys. In a case study of Island Scrub‐Jays (
              Aphelocoma insularis
              ), posterior modes for presence, availability, and detection probabilities were 0.78, 0.96, and 0.26, respectively, from 10‐min point counts repeated at 97 sites on three occasions, with noticeable differences among available, present, and superpopulation abundance estimates. This generalizable framework integrates common sampling protocols and provides joint inferences on the components of detection probability, spatial and non‐spatial temporary emigration, and abundance in unmarked populations.},

	abstract = {Proportion variables, also known as compositional data, are very common in ecology. Unfortunately, few scientists are aware of how compositional data, when used as covariates, can adversely impact statistical analysis. We describe here how proportion covariates result in multicollinearity and parameter identifiability problems. Using simulated data on bird species richness as a function of land use, we show how these problems manifest when fitting a wide range of models in R, both in a frequentist and Bayesian framework. In particular, we show that similar models can often generate substantially different parameter estimates, leading to very different conclusions. Dropping a covariate or the intercept from the model can solve the multicollinearity and parameter identifiability problems. Unfortunately, these solutions do not fix the inherent challenges associated with interpreting parameter estimates. To this end, we propose focusing the interpretation on the difference of slope parameters to avoid the inherent unidentifiability of individual parameters. We also propose conditional plots with two x-axes and marginal plots as visualization techniques that can help users better interpret their modeling results. We illustrate these problems and proposed solutions using empirical data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The practical and straightforward approaches suggested in this article will help the fitting of linear models and interpretation of its results when some of the covariates are proportions.},

	abstract = {Land managers must find a compromise between rapidly changing landscapes and biodiversity conservation through ecological networks. Estimating ecological networks is a key approach to enhance or maintain functional connectivity by identifying the nodes and links of a graph, which represent habitats and their corresponding functional corridors, respectively. To understand the current state of biodiversity, it is necessary to consider dynamic landscape connectivity while relying on relevant land cover maps. Although a current land cover map is relatively easy to produce using existing data, this is challenging for past landscapes. Here we investigated the impact of changes in landscape connectivity in an urban landscape at a fine scale on the habitat availability of two bird species: the tree pipit Anthus trivialis and the short-toed treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla. These species, exhibiting different niche ecologies, have shown contrasting population trends at a medium-term scale. The occurrences of C. brachydactyla were better correlated with resistance values that maximise the use of corridors, whereas the occurrences of A. trivialis better fitted with intermediate resistance values. The statistical approach indirectly highlighted relevant information about the ecology the capacity of both species to use urban habitats. Landscape connectivity increased for both species over the 24-year study period and may have implications for local abundances, which could explain, at the national scale, the increase in populations of C. brachydactyla, but not the decrease in populations of A. trivialis. Thus, more attention must be paid on rural habitats and their associated species that are more impacted by human activities, but efforts could also be achieved in urban areas especially for highly corridor-dependent species. Studying dynamic landscape connectivity at a fine scale is essential for estimating past and future land cover changes and their associated impacts on ecological networks, to better reconcile human and biodiversity concerns in land management.},

Two specific questions arise with surprising regularity among colleagues and students when interpreting and reporting AIC model tables. The first is related to the issue of ‘pretending’ variables, and specifically a muddled understanding of what this means. The second is related to

            Integrated community models—an emerging framework in which multiple data sources for multiple species are analyzed simultaneously—offer opportunities to expand inferences beyond the single‐species and single‐data‐source approaches common in ecology. We developed a novel integrated community model that combines distance sampling and single‐visit count data; within the model, information is shared among data sources (via a joint likelihood) and species (via a random‐effects structure) to estimate abundance patterns across a community. Parameters relating to abundance are shared between data sources, and the model can specify either shared or separate observation processes for each data source. Simulations demonstrated that the model provided unbiased estimates of abundance and detection parameters even when detection probabilities varied between the data types. The integrated community model also provided more accurate and more precise parameter estimates than alternative single‐species and single‐data‐source models in many instances. We applied the model to a community of 11 herbivore species in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, and found considerable interspecific variation in response to local wildlife management practices: Five species showed higher abundances in a region with passive conservation enforcement (median across species: 4.5× higher), three species showed higher abundances in a region with active conservation enforcement (median: 3.9× higher), and the remaining three species showed no abundance differences between the two regions. Furthermore, the community average of abundance was slightly higher in the region with active conservation enforcement but not definitively so (posterior mean: higher by 0.20 animals; 95\% credible interval: 1.43 fewer animals, 1.86 more animals). Our integrated community modeling framework has the potential to expand the scope of inference over space, time, and levels of biological organization, but practitioners should carefully evaluate whether model assumptions are met in their systems and whether data integration is valuable for their applications.},

            Advances in hierarchical modeling have improved estimation of ecological parameters from count data, especially those quantifying population abundance, distribution, and dynamics by explicitly accounting for observation processes, particularly incomplete detection. Even hierarchical models that account for incomplete detection, however, cannot compensate for data limitations stemming from poorly planned sampling. Ecologists therefore need guidance for planning count‐based studies that follow established sampling theory, collect appropriate data, and apply current modeling approaches to answer their research questions. We synthesize available literature relevant to guiding count‐based studies. Considering the central historical and ongoing contributions of avian studies to ecological knowledge, we focus on birds as a case study for this review, but the basic principles apply to all populations whose members are sufficiently observable to be counted. The sequence of our review represents the thought process in which we encourage ecologists to engage 1) the research question(s) and population parameters to measure, 2) sampling design, 3) analytical framework, 4) temporal design, and 5) survey protocol. We also provide 2 hypothetical demonstrations of these study plan components representing different research questions and study systems. Mirroring the structure of hierarchical models, we suggest researchers primarily focus on the ecological processes of interest when designing their approach to sampling, and wait to consider logistical constraints of data collection and observation processes when developing the survey protocol. We offer a broad framework for researchers planning count‐based studies, while pointing to relevant literature elaborating on particular tools and concepts.},

            Our ecological studies on large varanid lizards in a remote region of tropical Australia reveal a direct benefit to collaboration with local indigenous people. Although they worked together, in pairs, western scientists and indigenous rangers found lizards with different behavioral phenotypes (“personalities”). The resultant broader sampling of the lizard population enabled us to detect positive effects of a conservation management intervention. Those effects would not have been evident from the subset of animals collected by western scientists, and hence, involvement by researchers from both cultures critically affected our conclusions and paved the way for large‐scale deployment of a novel conservation initiative in Northern Australia.},

Focusing on threatened species in the US and Canada, we show that detectability information appears to be lacking for most species that are conservation priorities. Although more research on species detection is needed, detectability estimates are important for many immediate decisions. Thus, we recommend: (1) estimating and accounting for detectability and designing rigorous surveys when confirming presence or absence is crucial. Otherwise, absence in surveys should be considered suggestive only and critical habitat should be managed even if species presences are unconfirmed. (2) When directly estimating detectability is prohibitively difficult, indirect estimates should be explored, for example through expert elicitation or trait‐based predictors. (3) Detectability should be explicitly incorporated into decisions to ensure that surveys and management actions are directed where they have the greatest potential benefit.},

              Integrated population models (
              IPM
              s) provide a unified framework for simultaneously analyzing data sets of different types to estimate vital rates, population size, and dynamics; assess contributions of demographic parameters to population changes; and assess population viability. Strengths of an
              IPM
              include the ability to estimate latent parameters and improve the precision of parameter estimates. We present a hierarchical
              IPM
              that combines two broad‐scale avian monitoring data sets: count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (
              BBS
              ) and capture–recapture data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (
              MAPS
              ) program. These data sets are characterized by large numbers of sample sites and observers, factors capable of inducing error in the sampling and observation processes. The
              IPM
              integrates the data sets by modeling the population abundance as a first‐order autoregressive function of the previous year's population abundance and vital rates.
              BBS
              counts were modeled as a log‐linear function of the annual index of population abundance, observation effects (observer identity and first survey year), and overdispersion. Vital rates modeled included adult apparent survival, estimated from a transient Cormack‐Jolly‐Seber model using
              MAPS
              data, and recruitment (surviving hatched birds from the previous season + dispersing adults) estimated as a latent parameter. An assessment of the
              IPM
              demonstrated it could recover true parameter values from 200 simulated data sets. The
              IPM
              was applied to data sets (1992–2008) of two bird species, Gray Catbird (
              Dumetella carolinensis
              ) and Wood Thrush (
              Hylocichla mustelina
              ) in the New England/Mid‐Atlantic coastal Bird Conservation Region of the
              United States
              . The Gray Catbird population was relatively stable (trend +0.4\% per yr), while the Wood Thrush population nearly halved (trend −4.5\% per yr) over the 17‐yr study period.
              IPM
              estimates of population growth rates, adult survival, and detection and residency probabilities were similar and as precise as estimates from the stand‐alone
              BBS
              and
              CJS
              models. A benefit of using the
              IPM
              was its ability to estimate the latent recruitment parameter. Annual growth rates for both species correlated more with recruitment than survival, and the relationship for Wood Thrush was stronger than for Gray Catbird. The
              IPM
              's unified modeling framework facilitates integration of these important data sets.},

                  Conservation planning requires extensive amounts of data, yet data collection is expensive, and there is often a trade‐off between the quantity and quality of data that can be collected. Researchers are increasingly turning to community science programs to meet their biodiversity data needs, yet the reliability of such data sources is still a common source of debate.
                
                
                  Here, we argue that professionally collected data are subject to many of the limitations and biases present in community science datasets. We explore four common criticisms of community science data, and comparable issues that exist in data collected by experts: spatial biases, observer variability, taxonomic biases and the misapplication of data. We then outline solutions to these problems that have been developed to make better use of community science data, but can (and should) be equally applied to both kinds of data.
                
                
                  We highlight four main solutions based on research using community science data that can be applied across all biodiversity data collection and research. Statistical techniques that have been developed for processing community science data can equally help account for spatial biases and observer variation in professional datasets. Benchmarking or vetting one dataset against another can strengthen evidence and uncover unknown sources of biases. Professional and community science datasets can be used together to fill knowledge gaps that are unique to each. Careful study design that accounts for the collection of relevant and important covariate data can help statistically account for sources of bias.
                
                
                  Currently, a double standard exists in how researchers view data collected by professionals versus those collected by community scientists. Our aim is to ensure that valuable community science data are given the prominent place they deserve, and that data collected by experts are appropriately vetted and biases accounted for using all the tools at our disposal.},

            Population trend estimates form the core of avian conservation assessments in North America and indicate important changes in the state of the natural world. The models used to estimate these trends would be more efficient and informative for conservation if they explicitly considered the spatial locations of the monitoring data. We created spatially explicit versions of some standard status and trend models applied to long-term monitoring data for birds across North America. We compared the spatial models to simpler non-spatial versions of the same models, fitting them to simulated data and real data from 3 broad-scale monitoring programs: the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), the Christmas Bird Count, and a collection of programs we refer to as Migrating Shorebird Surveys. All the models generally reproduced the simulated trends and population trajectories when there were many data, and the spatial models performed better when there were fewer data and in locations where the local trends differed from the range-wide means. When fit to real data, the spatial models revealed interesting spatial patterns in trend, such as recent population increases along the Appalachian Mountains for the Eastern Whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus), that were much less apparent in results from the non-spatial versions. The spatial models also had higher out-of-sample predictive accuracy than the non-spatial models for a selection of species using BBS data. The spatially explicit sharing of information allows fitting the models with much smaller strata, allowing for finer-grained patterns in trends. Spatially informed trends will facilitate more locally relevant conservation, highlight areas of conservation successes and challenges, and help generate and test hypotheses about the spatially dependent drivers of population change.},

            The status and trend estimates derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) are critical sources of information for bird conservation. However, the estimates are partly dependent on the statistical model used. Therefore, multiple models are useful because not all of the varied uses of these estimates (e.g., inferences about long-term change, annual fluctuations, population cycles, and recovery of once-declining populations) are supported equally well by a single statistical model. Here we describe Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models (GAMs) for the BBS, which share information on the pattern of population change across a species’ range. We demonstrate the models and their benefits using data from a selection of species, and we run full cross-validation of the GAMs against 2 other models to compare the predictive fit. The GAMs have a better predictive fit than the standard model for all species studied here and comparable predictive fit to an alternative first difference model. In addition, one version of the GAM described here (GAMYE) estimates a population trajectory that can be decomposed into a smooth component and the annual fluctuations around that smooth component. This decomposition allows trend estimates based only on the smooth component, which are more stable between years and are therefore particularly useful for trend-based status assessments, such as those by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It also allows for the easy customization of the model to incorporate covariates that influence the smooth component separately from those that influence annual fluctuations (e.g., climate cycles vs. annual precipitation). For these reasons and more, this GAMYE model is a particularly useful model for the BBS-based status and trend estimates.},

            We combined Breeding Bird Survey point count protocol and distance sampling to survey spring migrant and breeding birds in Vicksburg National Military Park on 33 days between March and June of 2003 and 2004. For 26 of 106 detected species, we used program DISTANCE to estimate detection probabilities and densities from 660 3-min point counts in which detections were recorded within four distance annuli. For most species, estimates of detection probability, and thereby density estimates, were improved through incorporation of the proportion of forest cover at point count locations as a covariate. Our results suggest Breeding Bird Surveys would benefit from the use of distance sampling and a quantitative characterization of habitat at point count locations. During spring migration, we estimated that the most common migrant species accounted for a population of 5000–9000 birds in Vicksburg National Military Park (636 ha). Species with average populations of {\textgreater}300 individuals during migration were: Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula). Of 56 species that bred in Vicksburg National Military Park, we estimated that the most common 18 species accounted for {\textgreater}8150 individuals. The six most abundant breeding species, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, White-eyed Vireo, Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), accounted for {\textgreater}5800 individuals.},

              1. 
              Species richness is often used as a tool for prioritizing conservation action. One method for predicting richness and other summaries of community structure is to develop species‐specific models of occurrence probability based on habitat or landscape characteristics. However, this approach can be challenging for rare or elusive species for which survey data are often sparse.
            
            
              2. 
              Recent developments have allowed for improved inference about community structure based on species‐specific models of occurrence probability, integrated within a hierarchical modelling framework. This framework offers advantages to inference about species richness over typical approaches by accounting for both species‐level effects and the aggregated effects of landscape composition on a community as a whole, thus leading to increased precision in estimates of species richness by improving occupancy estimates for all species, including those that were observed infrequently.
            
            
              3. 
              We developed a hierarchical model to assess the community response of breeding birds in the Hudson River Valley, New York, to habitat fragmentation and analysed the model using a Bayesian approach.
            
            
              4. 
              The model was designed to estimate species‐specific occurrence and the effects of fragment area and edge (as measured through the perimeter and the perimeter/area ratio, P/A), while accounting for imperfect detection of species.
            
            
              5. 
              We used the fitted model to make predictions of species richness within forest fragments of variable morphology. The model revealed that species richness of the observed bird community was maximized in small forest fragments with a high P/A. However, the number of forest interior species, a subset of the community with high conservation value, was maximized in large fragments with low P/A.
            
            
              6. 
              Synthesis and applications
              . Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the responses of both individual, and groups of species, to environmental heterogeneity while illustrating the utility of hierarchical models for inference about species richness for conservation. This framework can be used to investigate the impacts of land‐use change and fragmentation on species or assemblage richness, and to further understand trade‐offs in species‐specific occupancy probabilities associated with landscape variability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Recent methodological advances permit the estimation of species richness and occurrences for rare species by linking species‐level occurrence models at the community level. The value of such methods is underscored by the ability to examine the influence of landscape heterogeneity on species assemblages at large spatial scales. A salient advantage of community‐level approaches is that parameter estimates for data‐poor species are more precise as the estimation process “borrows” from data‐rich species. However, this analytical benefit raises a question about the degree to which inferences are dependent on the implicit assumption of relatedness among species. Here, we assess the sensitivity of community/group‐level metrics, and individual‐level species inferences given various classification schemes for grouping species assemblages using multispecies occurrence models. We explore the implications of these groupings on parameter estimates for avian communities in two ecosystems: tropical forests in Puerto Rico and temperate forests in northeastern United States. We report on the classification performance and extent of variability in occurrence probabilities and species richness estimates that can be observed depending on the classification scheme used. We found estimates of species richness to be most precise and to have the best predictive performance when all of the data were grouped at a single community level. Community/group‐level parameters appear to be heavily influenced by the grouping criteria, but were not driven strictly by total number of detections for species. We found different grouping schemes can provide an opportunity to identify unique assemblage responses that would not have been found if all of the species were analyzed together. We suggest three guidelines: (1) classification schemes should be determined based on study objectives; (2) model selection should be used to quantitatively compare different classification approaches; and (3) sensitivity of results to different classification approaches should be assessed. These guidelines should help researchers apply hierarchical community models in the most effective manner.},

            We simulated bird surveys using recorded bird songs to assess factors affecting detection probability in grassland bird point counts. We used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate effects of those factors and to estimate and visualize the variation in the area around the observer where birds can be perceived (the perception area). We simulated surveys with 8,926 binary opportunities for detection in Minnesota grasslands in 2011 and 2012. Species, distance to the observer, wind speed and direction, observer, and density of vegetation all affected detection of recorded bird songs. Species had a strong effect; the size of the predicted perception area around the observer differed by an order of magnitude among species. Wind also had a strong effect on detection. As wind speed increased, probability of detection downwind of the observer was reduced and the perception area around the observer became smaller and more asymmetrical. The effective distance at which an observer is more likely to detect a bird than not detect it may differ among species and angles to the wind, even within the same survey. Eight of 10 species had low probability of misidentification (≤0.03), but Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) and LeConte’s Sparrow (Ammospiza leconteii) were frequently misidentified (probability = 0.09–0.24 among observers), contributing to a low rate of correct detection for those species. We recommend collecting point-count data within distance bands so that data can be analyzed based on the effective radius for each species and standardizing surveys across wind conditions to reduce variation in detection probability.},

            Environmental differences influence the evolutionary divergence of mating signals through selection acting either directly on signal transmission (“sensory drive”) or because morphological adaptation to different foraging niches causes divergence in “magic traits” associated with signal production, thus indirectly driving signal evolution. Sensory drive and magic traits both contribute to variation in signal structure, yet we have limited understanding of the relative role of these direct and indirect processes during signal evolution. Using phylogenetic analyses across 276 species of ovenbirds (Aves: Furnariidae), we compared the extent to which song evolution was related to the direct influence of habitat characteristics and the indirect effect of body size and beak size, two potential magic traits in birds. We find that indirect ecological selection, via diversification in putative magic traits, explains variation in temporal, spectral, and performance features of song. Body size influences song frequency, whereas beak size limits temporal and performance components of song. In comparison, direct ecological selection has weaker and more limited effects on song structure. Our results illustrate the importance of considering multiple deterministic processes in the evolution of mating signals.},

Arguably, such change is not welcomed by all, but a change in overlap across decades is needed to sustain and improve upon how the planet's biological diversity can coexist with increasingly difficult human conditions. Given that 80\% of the people in the United States live in urban areas, with similar numbers internationally, a future possibility may be an even greater divide between wild nature, ecological services, and enjoyment in the field. This is disturbing. Despite fundamental scientific insights that help understand critical components of the natural world, once society loses touch with nature, what will remain?},

            Ecological inferences are often based on the locations at which species are present, but many species records have substantial uncertainty in spatial metadata, limiting their utility for fine-scale analyses. This is especially prevalent in historical records such as museum specimens, and in some citizen-science data. For example, the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) has 55+ years of bird data from regular transects (“routes”) across the continent but was not designed to capture the spatial component of point count events, limiting analyses of species-habitat relationships for which it would otherwise be well suited. We present a new methodology for quantifying location uncertainty in BBS records using digitized estimated stop locations, deriving the corresponding environmental covariate uncertainty distributions, and incorporating this information into hierarchical species distribution models using informative Bayesian priors. This approach allows for estimation of species–environment relationships in a way that fully accounts for underlying spatial uncertainty. We quantify stop-location uncertainty in BBS data across the central United States, model bird–land cover relationships in the upper Midwest, and validate our method by comparing posterior land cover estimates to known covariate values for a subset of GPS-digitized stop locations. We provide code for implementing this method in R. Posterior land cover estimates (forest, grass/hay, and developed land cover), based on our informative priors, were highly correlated with known land cover values from GPS-digitized stop locations. Our approach thus makes it possible to responsibly leverage large historic and citizen science databases, such as the BBS, for fine-scale ecological analyses.},
